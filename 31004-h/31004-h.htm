<h2><a name="PUBLISHERS_PREFACE" id="PUBLISHERS_PREFACE"></a>PUBLISHERS' PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The fact that a well-printed edition of this notable
story has not been in print either in England or
America since its original publication in 1841 is a
sufficient reason for the present edition.</p>

<p>It includes the valuable notes in which the author
elucidated the "many legal topics contained in the
work, enabling the non-professional reader to understand
more easily the somewhat complex and elaborate
<i>plot</i> of the story."</p>

<p>Of the story itself it is hardly necessary to speak.
Always deservedly popular, it has been widely read
for nearly fifty years in England and America, has
been translated into French and German, and has
only required to be presented in a pleasing form,
with readable type and good paper, to insure it the
circulation which it deserves.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE_TO_THE_FIRST_EDITION" id="PREFACE_TO_THE_FIRST_EDITION"></a>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h2>


<p>The Author of this Work begs gratefully to express
his conviction that no small share of any
success which it may have met with, is attributable
to the circumstance of its having had the advantage
of an introduction to the public through the
medium of <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>&mdash;a distinguished
periodical, to which he feels it an honor to have
been, for a time, a contributor.</p>

<p>One word, only, he ventures to offer, with reference
to the general character and tendency of
"<span class="smcap">Ten Thousand a-Year</span>." He has occasionally
observed it spoken of as "an amusing and laughable"
story; but he cannot help thinking that no
one will so characterize it, who may take the
trouble of reading it throughout, and be capable
of comprehending its scope and object. Whatever
may be its defects of execution, it has been written
in a grave and earnest spirit; with no attempt
whatever to render it acceptable to <i>mere</i> novel-readers;
but with a steadfast view to that development
and illustration, whether humorously or
otherwise, of principles, of character, and of conduct,
which the author had proposed to himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
from the first, in the hope that he might secure
the approbation of persons of sober, independent,
and experienced judgment.</p>

<p>Literature is not the author's profession. Having
been led, by special circumstances only, to
commence writing this work, he found it impossible
to go on, without sacrificing to it a large
portion of the time usually allotted to repose, at
some little cost both of health and spirits. This
was, however, indispensable, in order to prevent
its interference with his professional avocations.
It has been written, also, under certain other considerable
disadvantages&mdash;which may account for
several imperfections in it during its original appearance.
The periodical interval of leisure which
his profession allows him, has enabled the author,
however, to give that revision to the whole, which
may render it worthier of the public favor. He
is greatly gratified by the reception which it has
already met with, both at home and abroad; and
in taking a final and a reluctant leave of the public,
ventures to express a hope, that this work may
prove to be an addition, however small and humble,
to the stock of healthy English literature.</p>

  TEN THOUSAND A-YEAR.

<hr />


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p>About ten o'clock one Sunday morning, in the month of
July 18&mdash;, the dazzling sunbeams, which had for several
hours irradiated a little dismal back attic in one of the
closest courts adjoining Oxford Street, in London, and
stimulated with their intensity the closed eyelids of a
young man&mdash;one <span class="smcap">Tittlebat Titmouse</span>&mdash;lying in bed, at
length awoke him. He rubbed his eyes for some time,
to relieve himself from the irritation occasioned by the
sudden glare they encountered; and yawned and stretched
his limbs with a heavy sense of weariness, as though his
sleep had not refreshed him. He presently cast his eyes
towards the heap of clothes lying huddled together on the
backless chair by the bedside, where he had hastily flung
them about an hour after midnight; at which time he
had returned from a great draper's shop in Oxford Street,
where he served as a shopman, and where he had nearly
dropped asleep, after a long day's work, in the act of
putting up the shutters. He could hardly keep his eyes
open while he undressed, short as was the time required
to do so; and on dropping exhausted into bed, there he
had continued, in deep unbroken slumber, till the moment
of his being presented to the reader.&mdash;He lay for several
minutes, stretching, yawning, and sighing, occasionally
casting an irresolute glance towards the tiny fireplace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
where lay a modicum of wood and coal, with a tinder-box
and a match or two placed upon the hob, so that he could
easily light his fire for the purposes of shaving, and breakfasting.
He stepped at length lazily out of bed, and when
he felt his feet, again yawned and stretched himself.
Then he lit his fire, placed his bit of a kettle on the top
of it, and returned to bed, where he lay with his eye fixed
on the fire, watching the crackling blaze insinuate itself
through the wood and coal. Once, however, it began to
fail, so he had to get up and assist it, by blowing, and bits
of paper; and it seemed in so precarious a state that he
determined not again to lie down, but sit on the bedside:
as he did, with his arms folded, ready to resume operations
if necessary. In this posture he remained for some
time, watching his little fire, and listlessly listening to the
discordant jangling of innumerable church-bells, clamorously
calling the citizens to their devotions. The current
of thoughts passing through his mind, was something like
the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Heigho!&mdash;Lud, Lud!&mdash;Dull as ditch water!&mdash;This
is my only holiday, yet I don't seem to enjoy it!&mdash;for I
feel knocked up with my week's work! (A yawn.) What
a life mine is, to be sure! Here am I, in my eight-and-twentieth
year, and for four long years have been one of
the shopmen at Tag-rag &amp; Co.'s, slaving from half-past
seven o'clock in the morning till nine at night, and all for
a salary of thirty-five pounds a-year, and my board! And
Mr. Tag-rag&mdash;eugh! what a beast!&mdash;is always telling
me how high he's raised my salary!! Thirty-five pounds
a-year is all I have for lodging, and turning out like a
gentleman! 'Pon my soul! it <i>can't</i> last; for sometimes
I feel getting desperate&mdash;such strange thoughts come
into my mind!&mdash;Seven shillings a-week do I pay for <i>this</i>
cursed hole&mdash;(he uttered these words with a bitter emphasis,
accompanied by a disgustful look round the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
room)&mdash;that one couldn't swing a cat in without touching
the four sides!&mdash;Last winter three of our gents (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
his fellow-shopmen) came to tea with me one Sunday
night; and bitter cold as it was, we four made this cussed
dog-hole so hot, we were obliged to open the window!&mdash;And
as for accommodation&mdash;I recollect I had to borrow
two nasty chairs from the people below, who on the next
Sunday borrowed my only decanter, in return, and, hang
them, cracked it!&mdash;Curse me, say I, if this life is worth
having! It's all the very vanity of vanities&mdash;as it's
said somewhere in the Bible&mdash;and no mistake! Fag,
fag, fag, all one's days, and&mdash;what for? Thirty-five
pounds a-year, and '<i>no advance!</i>' (Here occurred a
pause and revery, from which he was roused by the
clangor of the church-bells.) Bah, bells! ring away till
you're all cracked!&mdash;Now do you think <i>I'm</i> going to be
mewed up in church on this the only day out of the seven
I've got to sweeten myself in, and sniff fresh air? A
precious joke that would be! (A yawn.) Whew!&mdash;after
all, I'd almost as lieve sit here; for what's the use of
my going out? Everybody I see out is happy, excepting
me, and the poor chaps that are like me!&mdash;Everybody
laughs when they see me, and know that I'm only a
tallow-faced counter-jumper&mdash;I know that's the odious
name we gents go by!&mdash;for whom it's no use to go out&mdash;for
one day in seven can't give one a bloom! Oh,
Lord! what's the use of being good-looking, as <i>some</i>
chaps say I am?"&mdash;Here he instinctively passed his left
hand through a profusion of sandy-colored hair, and cast
an eye towards the bit of fractured looking-glass which
hung against the wall, and had, by faithfully representing
to him a by no means ugly set of features (despite the
dismal hue of his hair) whenever he chose to appeal to it,
afforded him more enjoyment than any other object in
the world, for years. "Ah, by Jove! many and many's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the fine gal I've done my best to attract the notice of,
while I was serving her in the shop&mdash;that is, when I've
seen her get out of a carriage! There has been luck to
many a chap like me, in the same line of speculation:
look at Tom Tarnish&mdash;how did he get Miss Twang, the
rich pianoforte-maker's daughter?&mdash;and <i>now</i> he's cut the
shop, and lives at Hackney, like a regular gentleman!
Ah! that <i>was</i> a stroke! But somehow it hasn't answered
with <i>me</i> yet; the gals don't take! How I have set my
eyes to be sure, and ogled them!&mdash;<i>All</i> of them don't
seem to dislike the thing&mdash;and sometimes they'll smile,
in a sort of way that says I'm safe&mdash;but it's been no
use yet, not a bit of it!&mdash;My eyes! catch me, by the
way, ever nodding again to a lady on the Sunday, that
had smiled when I stared at her while serving her in the
shop&mdash;after what happened to me a month or two ago
in the Park! Didn't I feel like damaged goods, just
then? But it's no matter, women are so different at different
times!&mdash;Very likely I mismanaged the thing.
By the way, what a precious puppy of a chap the fellow
was that came up to her at the time she stepped out of
her carriage to walk a bit! As for good looks&mdash;cut me
to ribbons (another glance at the glass) no; I a'n't afraid
<i>there</i>, neither&mdash;but&mdash;heigho!&mdash;I suppose he was, as
they say, born with a golden spoon in his mouth, and had
never so many a thousand a-year, to make up to him for
never so few brains! He was uncommon well-dressed,
though, I must own. What trousers!&mdash;they stuck so
natural to him, he might have been born in them. And
his waistcoat, and satin stock&mdash;what an air! And yet,
his figure was nothing <i>very</i> out of the way! His gloves,
as white as snow; I've no doubt he wears a pair of them
a-day&mdash;my stars! that's three-and-sixpence a-day; for
don't I know what <i>they</i> cost?&mdash;Whew! if I had but the
cash to carry on that sort of thing!&mdash;And when he'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
seen her into her carriage&mdash;the horse he got on!&mdash;and
what a tip-top groom&mdash;that chap's wages, I'll answer for
it, were equal to my salary! (Here was another pause.)
Now, just for the fun of the thing, only suppose luck was
to befall <i>me</i>! Say that somebody was to leave me lots
of cash&mdash;many thousands a-year, or something in that
line! My stars! wouldn't I go it with the best of them!
(Another long pause.) Gad, I really should hardly know
how to begin to spend it!&mdash;I think, by the way, I'd buy
a <i>title</i> to set off with&mdash;for what won't money buy? The
thing's often done; there was a great pawn-broker in the
city, the other day, made a baronet of, all for his money&mdash;and
why shouldn't I?" He grew a little heated with
the progress of his reflections, clasping his hands with involuntary
energy, as he stretched them out to their fullest
extent, to give effect to a very hearty yawn. "Lord, only
think how it would sound!&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">sir tittlebat titmouse, baronet</span>;" or, "<span class="smcap">lord titmouse</span>!!"</p></div>

<p>"The very first place I'd go to, after I'd got my title,
and was rigged out in Tight-fit's tip-top, should be&mdash;our
cursed shop! to buy a dozen or two pair of white kid.
Ah, ha! What a flutter there would be among the poor
pale devils as were standing, just as ever, behind the
counters, at Tag-rag and Co.'s when my carriage drew up,
and I stepped, a tip-top swell, into the shop. Tag-rag
would come and attend to me himself! No, he wouldn't&mdash;pride
wouldn't let him. I don't know, though: what
wouldn't he do to turn a penny, and make two and nine-pence
into three and a penny? I shouldn't <i>quite</i> come
Captain Stiff over him, I think, just at first; but I should
treat him with a kind of an air, too, as if&mdash;hem! 'Pon
my life! how delightful! (A sigh and a pause.) Yes,
I should often come to the shop. Gad, it would be half
the fun of my fortune! How they would envy me, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
sure! How one should enjoy it! I wouldn't think of
<i>marrying</i> till&mdash;and yet I won't say either; if I got
among some of them out-and-outers&mdash;those first-rate
articles&mdash;that lady, for instance, the other day in the
Park&mdash;I should like to see her cut me as she did, with
ten thousand a-year in my pocket! Why, she'd be running
after <i>me</i>!&mdash;or there's no truth in novels, which
I'm sure there's often a great deal in. Oh, of course,
I might marry whom I pleased! Who couldn't be got
with ten thousand a-year? (Another pause.) I think I
should go abroad to Russia directly; for they tell me
there's a man lives there who could dye this cussed hair
of mine any color I liked&mdash;and&mdash;egad! I'd come home
as black as a crow, and hold up my head as high as any
of them! While I was about it, I'd have a touch at my
eyebrows"&mdash;&mdash; Crash here went all his castle-building,
at the sound of his tea-kettle, hissing, whizzing, sputtering,
in the agonies of boiling over; as if the intolerable
heat of the fire had driven desperate the poor creature
placed upon it, which instinctively tried thus to extinguish
the cause of its anguish. Having taken it off, and
placed it upon the hob, and put on the fire a tiny fragment
of fresh coal, he began to make preparations for
shaving, by pouring some of the hot water into an old
tea-cup, which was presently to serve for the purposes of
breakfast. Then he spread out a bit of crumpled whity-brown
paper, in which had been folded up a couple of
cigars, bought over-night for the Sunday's special enjoyment&mdash;and
as to which, if he supposed they had come
from any place beyond the four seas, I imagine him to
have been slightly mistaken. He placed this bit of paper
on the little mantel-piece; drew his solitary well-worn
razor several times across the palm of his left hand;
dipped his brush, worn, within half an inch, to the stump,
into the hot water; presently passed it over so much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
his face as he intended to shave; then rubbed on the
damp surface a bit of yellow soap&mdash;and in less than five
minutes Mr. Titmouse was a shaved man. But mark&mdash;don't
suppose that he had performed an extensive operation.
One would have thought him anxious to get rid of
as much as possible of his abominable sandy-colored hair.
Quite the contrary! Every hair of his spreading whiskers
was sacred from the touch of steel; and a bushy crop of
hair stretched underneath his chin, coming curled out on
each side of it, above his stock, like two little horns or
tusks. An imperial&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> a dirt-colored tuft of hair,
permitted to grow perpendicularly down the under-lip of
puppies&mdash;and a pair of promising mustaches, poor Mr.
Titmouse had been compelled to sacrifice some time before,
to the tyrannical whimsies of his vulgar employer,
Mr. Tag-rag, who imagined them not to be exactly suitable
appendages for counter-jumpers. Thus will it be
seen that the space shaved over on this occasion was
somewhat circumscribed. This operation over, he took
out of his trunk an old dirty-looking pomatum pot. A
modicum of its contents, extracted on the tips of his two
forefingers, he stroked carefully into his eyebrows; then
spreading some on the palms of his hands, he rubbed it
vigorously into his stubborn hair and whiskers for some
quarter of an hour; afterwards combing and brushing his
hair into half a dozen different dispositions&mdash;so fastidious
in that matter was Mr. Titmouse. Then he dipped the
end of a towel into a little water, and twisting it round
his right forefinger, passed it gently over his face, carefully
avoiding his eyebrows, and the hair at the top, sides,
and bottom of his face, which he then wiped with a dry
corner of the towel; and no farther did Mr. Tittlebat
Titmouse think it necessary to carry his ablutions. Had
he, however, been able to "see himself as others saw
him," in respect of those neglected regions which lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
somewhere behind and beneath his ears, he might not,
possibly, have thought it superfluous to irrigate them
with a little soap and water; but, after all, he knew best;
it might have given him cold: and besides, his hair was
very thick and long behind, and might perhaps conceal
anything that was unsightly. Then Mr. Titmouse drew
from underneath the bed a bottle of "incomparable blacking,"
and a couple of brushes; with great labor and skill
polishing his boots up to a wonderful degree of brilliancy.
Having replaced his blacking implements under the bed
and washed his hands, he devoted a few moments to boiling
about three tea-spoonfuls of coffee, (as it was styled
on the paper from which he took, and in which he had
bought, it&mdash;whereas it was, in fact, <i>chiccory</i>.) Then he
drew forth from his trunk a calico shirt, with linen wristbands
and collar, which had been worn only twice&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
on the preceding two Sundays&mdash;since its last washing&mdash;and
put it on, taking great care not to rumple a very
showy front, containing three rows of frills; in the middle
one of which he stuck three "studs," connected together
with two little gilt chains, looking exceedingly stylish&mdash;especially
when coupled with a span-new satin stock,
which he next buckled round his neck. Having put on
his bright boots, (without, I am really sorry to say, any
stockings,) he carefully insinuated his legs into a pair of
white trousers, for the first time since their last washing;
and what with his short straps and high braces, they were
so tight that you would have feared their bursting if he
should have sat down hastily. I am almost afraid that
I shall hardly be believed; but it is a fact, that the next
thing he did was to attach a pair of spurs to his boots:&mdash;but,
to be sure, it was not <i>impossible</i> that he might intend
to ride during the day. Then he put on a queer kind of
under-waistcoat, which in fact was only a roll-collar of
rather faded pea-green silk, and designed to set off a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
fine flowered damson-colored silk waistcoat; over which
he drew a massive mosaic-gold chain, (to purchase which
he had sold a serviceable silver watch,) which had been
carefully wrapped up in cotton wool; from which soft
depository, also, he drew <span class="smcap">his ring</span>, (those must have been
sharp eyes which could tell, at a distance, and in a hurry,
that it was not diamond,) which he placed on the stumpy
little finger of his red and thick right hand&mdash;and contemplated
its sparkle with exquisite satisfaction. Having
proceeded thus far with his toilet, he sat down to his
breakfast, spreading upon his lap the shirt which he had
taken off, to preserve his white trousers from spot or
stain&mdash;his thoughts alternating between his late waking
vision and his purposes for the day. He had no butter,
having used the last on the preceding morning; so he
was fain to put up with dry bread&mdash;and very dry and
teeth-trying it was, poor fellow&mdash;but his eye lit on his
ring! Having swallowed two cups of his <i>quasi</i>-coffee,
(eugh! such stuff!) he resumed his toilet, by drawing
out of his other trunk his blue surtout, with embossed
silk buttons and velvet collar, and an outside pocket in
the left breast. Having smoothed down a few creases, he
put it on:&mdash;then, before his little vulgar fraction of a
looking-glass, he stood twitching about the collar, and
sleeves, and front, so as to make them sit well; concluding
with a careful elongation of the wristbands of his
shirt, so as to show their whiteness gracefully beyond the
cuff of his coat-sleeve&mdash;and he succeeded in producing a
sort of white boundary line between the blue of his coat-sleeve
and the red of his hand. At that useful member
he could not help looking with a sigh, as he had often
done before&mdash;for it was not a handsome hand. It was
broad and red, and the fingers were thick and stumpy,
with very coarse deep wrinkles at every joint. His nails
also were flat and shapeless; and he used to be continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
gnawing them till he had succeeded in getting them
down to the quick&mdash;and they were a sight to set one's
teeth on edge. Then he extracted from the first-mentioned
trunk a white pocket handkerchief&mdash;an exemplary
one, that had gone through four Sundays' show, (not <i>use</i>,
be it understood,) and yet was capable of exhibition
again. A pair of sky-colored kid gloves next made their
appearance: which, however, showed such barefaced marks
of former service as rendered indispensable a ten minutes'
rubbing with bread-crumbs. His Sunday hat, carefully
covered with silver-paper, was next gently removed from
its well-worn box&mdash;ah, how lightly and delicately did he
pass his smoothing hand round its glossy surface! Lastly,
he took down a thin black cane, with a gilt head, and full
brown tassel, from a peg behind the door&mdash;and his toilet
was complete. Laying down his cane for a moment, he
passed his hands again through his hair, arranging it so
as to fall nicely on each side beneath his hat, which he
then placed upon his head, with an elegant inclination
towards the left side. He was really not bad-looking, in
spite of his sandy-colored hair. His forehead, to be sure,
was contracted, and his eyes were of a very light color,
and a trifle too protuberant; but his mouth was rather
well-formed, and being seldom closed, exhibited very beautiful
teeth; and his nose was of that description which
generally passes for a Roman nose. His countenance
wore generally a smile, and was expressive of&mdash;self-satisfaction:
and surely any expression is better than none at
all. As for there being the slightest trace of <i>intellect</i> in
it, I should be misleading the reader if I were to say anything
of the sort. In height, he was about five feet and
a quarter of an inch, <i>in his boots</i>, and he was rather
strongly set, with a little tendency to round shoulders:&mdash;but
his limbs were pliant, and his motions nimble.</p>

<p>Here you have, then, Mr. Tittlebat Titmouse to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
life&mdash;certainly no more than an average sample of his
kind; but as he is to go through a considerable variety
of situation and circumstance, I thought you would like
to have him as distinctly before your mind's eye as it was
in my power to present him.&mdash;Well&mdash;he put his hat on,
as I have said; buttoned the lowest two buttons of his
surtout, and stuck his white pocket handkerchief into the
outside pocket in front, as already mentioned, anxiously
disposing it so as to let a little appear above the edge of
the pocket, with a sort of careful carelessness&mdash;a graceful
contrast to the blue; drew on his gloves; took his cane
in his hand; drained the last sad remnant of infusion of
chiccory in his coffee-cup; and, the sun shining in the full
splendor of a July noon, and promising a glorious day,
forth sallied this poor fellow, an Oxford Street Adonis,
going forth conquering and to conquer! Petty finery
without, a pinched and stinted stomach within; a case of
Back <i>versus</i> Belly, (as the lawyers would have it,) the
plaintiff winning in a canter! Forth sallied, I say, Mr.
Titmouse, as also, doubtless, sallied forth that day some
five or six thousand similar personages, down the narrow,
creaking, close staircase, which he had no sooner quitted
than he heard exclaimed from an opposite window, "My
eyes! <i>a'n't</i> that a swell!" He felt how true the observation
was, and that at that moment he was somewhat
out of his element; so he hurried on, and soon reached
that great broad disheartening street, apostrophized by
the celebrated Opium-Eater,[<a href='#Note_1'>1</a>] with bitter feeling, as&mdash;"Oxford
Street!&mdash;stony-hearted stepmother! Thou
that listenest to the sighs of orphans, and drinkest the
tears of children!" Here, though his spirits were not
just then very buoyant, our poor little dandy breathed
more freely than when he was passing through the
wretched crowded court (Closet Court) which he had just
quitted. He passed and met hundreds who, like himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
seemed released for a precious day's interval from miserable
confinement and slavery during the week; but there
were not very many of them who could vie with him in
elegance of appearance&mdash;and that was indeed a luxurious
reflection! Who could do justice to the air with which
he strutted along! He felt as happy, poor soul, in his
little ostentation, as his Corinthian rival in tip-top turn-out,
after twice as long, and as anxious, and fifty times
as expensive, preparations for effective public display!
Nay, <i>my</i> poor swell was in some respects greatly the
superior of such an one as I have alluded to. Mr. Titmouse
<i>did</i>, to a great degree, bedizen his back&mdash;but at
the expense of his belly; whereas, the Corinthian exquisite,
too often taking advantage of station and influence,
recklessly both pampers his luxurious appetite within,
and decorates his person without, at the expense of innumerable
heart-aching creditors. I do not mean, however,
to claim any real merit for Mr. Titmouse on this
score, because I am not sure how he would act if he
were to become possessed of his magnificent rival's means
and opportunities for the perpetration of gentlemanly
frauds on a splendid scale.&mdash;But we shall perhaps see
by and by.</p>

<p>Mr. Titmouse walked along with leisurely step; for
haste and perspiration were vulgar, and he had the day
before him. Observe, now, the careless glance of self-satisfaction
with which he occasionally regards his bright
boots, with their martial appendage, giving out a faint
clinking sound as he heavily treads the broad flags; his
spotless trousers, his tight surtout, and the tip of white
handkerchief peeping <i>accidentally</i> out in front! A pleasant
sight it was to behold him in a chance rencontre with
some one genteel enough to be recognized&mdash;as he stood,
resting on his left leg; his left arm stuck upon his hip;
his right leg easily bent outwards; his right hand lightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
holding his ebon cane, with the gilt head of which he
occasionally tapped his teeth; and his eyes, half closed,
scrutinizing the face and figure of each "<i>pretty gal</i>" as
she passed, and to whom he had a delicious consciousness
that he appeared an object of interest! This was indeed
<span class="smcap">happiness</span>, as far as his forlorn condition could admit of
his enjoying happiness.&mdash;He had no particular object in
view. A tiff over-night with two of his shopmates, had
broken off a party which they had agreed the Sunday preceding
in forming, to go that day to Greenwich; and this
trifling circumstance had a little soured his temper, depressed
as had been his spirits before. He resolved, on
consideration, to walk straight on, and dine somewhere a
little way out of town, by way of passing the time till
four o'clock, at which hour he intended to make his
appearance in Hyde Park, "to see the swells and the
fashions," which was his favorite Sunday occupation.</p>

<p>His condition was, indeed, forlorn in the extreme. To
say nothing of his <i>prospects</i> in life&mdash;what was his present
condition? A shopman with thirty-five pounds a-year,
out of which he had to find his clothing, washing, lodging,
and all other incidental expenses&mdash;the chief item of his
board&mdash;such as it was&mdash;being found him by his employers!
He was five weeks in arrear to his landlady&mdash;a
corpulent old termagant, whom nothing could have induced
him to risk offending, but his overmastering love
of finery; for I grieve to say, that this deficiency had been
occasioned by his purchase of the ring he then wore with
so much pride! How he had contrived to pacify her&mdash;lie
upon lie he must have had recourse to&mdash;I know not.
He was indebted also to his poor washerwoman in five or
six shillings for at least a quarter's washing; and owed
five times that amount to a little old tailor, who, with
huge spectacles on his nose, turned up to him, out of a
little cupboard which he occupied in Closet Court, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
which Titmouse had to pass whenever he went to or from
his lodgings, a lean, sallow, wrinkled face, imploring him
to "settle his small account." All the cash in hand
which he had to meet contingencies between that day and
quarter-day, which was six weeks off, was about twenty-six
shillings, of which he had taken one for the present
day's expenses!</p>

<p>Revolving these somewhat disheartening matters in his
mind, he passed easily and leisurely along the whole
length of Oxford Street. No one could have judged from
his dressy appearance, the constant smirk on his face, and
his confident air, how very miserable that poor little
dandy was; but three-fourths of his misery were really
occasioned by the impossibility he felt of his ever being
able to indulge in his propensities for finery and display.
Nothing better had he to occupy his few thoughts. He had
had only a plain mercantile education, as it is called, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
reading, writing, and arithmetic; beyond an exceedingly
moderate acquaintance with these, he knew nothing
whatever; not having read anything except a few inferior
novels, and plays, and sporting newspapers. Deplorable,
however, as were his circumstances&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hope springs eternal in the human breast."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And probably, in common with most who are miserable
from straitened circumstances, he often conceived, and
secretly relied upon, the possibility of some unexpected
and accidental change for the better. He had heard and
read of extraordinary cases of <span class="smcap">luck</span>. Why might he not
be one of the <span class="smcap">lucky</span>? A rich girl might fall in love with
him&mdash;that was, poor fellow! in his consideration, one of
the least unlikely ways of luck's advent; or some one
might leave him money; or he might win a prize in the
lottery;&mdash;all these, and other accidental modes of getting
rich, frequently occurred to the well-regulated mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of Mr. Tittlebat Titmouse; but he never once thought
of one thing, viz. of determined, unwearying industry,
perseverance, and integrity in the way of his business,
conducing to such a result!</p>

<p>Is his case a solitary one?&mdash;Dear reader, <i>you</i> may be
unlike poor Tittlebat Titmouse in every respect except <i>one</i>!</p>

<p>On he walked towards Bayswater; and finding that it
was yet early, and considering that the farther he went
from town the better prospect there would be of his being
able, with little sacrifice of appearances, to get a dinner
consistent with the means he carried about with him, viz.
one shilling, he pursued his way a mile or two beyond
Bayswater; and, sure enough, came at length upon a
nice little public-house on the roadside, called the Square-toes
Arms. Very tired, and very dusty, he first sat down
in a small back room to rest himself; and took the opportunity
to call for a clothes-brush and shoe-brush, to
relieve his clothes and boots from the heavy dust upon
them. Having thus attended to his outer man, as far as
circumstances would permit, he bethought himself of his
inner man, whose cravings he presently satisfied with a
pretty substantial mutton-pie and a pint of porter. This
fare, together with a penny (which he felt <i>forced</i> to give)
to the little girl who waited on him, cost him tenpence;
and then, having somewhat refreshed himself, he began
to think of returning to town. Having lit one of his two
cigars, he sallied forth, puffing along with an air of quiet
enjoyment. Dinner, however humble, seldom fails, especially
when accompanied by a fair draught of tolerable
porter, in some considerable degree to tranquillize the
animal spirits; and that soothing effect began soon to be
experienced by Mr. Titmouse. The sedative <i>cause</i> he
erroneously considered to be the cigar he was smoking;
whereas in fact the only tobacco he had imbibed was from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the porter. But, however that might be, he certainly
returned towards town in a calmer and more cheerful
humor than that in which he had quitted it an hour or
two before.</p>

<p>As he approached Cumberland Gate, it was about half-past
five; and the Park might be said to be at its <i>acme</i>
of fashion, as far as that could be indicated by a sluggish
stream of carriages, three and four abreast&mdash;coroneted
panels in abundance&mdash;noble and well-known equestrians
of both sexes, in troops&mdash;and some hundreds of pedestrians
of the same description. So continuous was the
throng of carriages and horsemen, that Titmouse did not
find it the easiest matter in the world to dart across to
the footpath in the inner circle. That, however, he presently
safely accomplished, encountering no more serious
mischance than the muttered "D&mdash;n your eyes!" of a
haughty groom, between whom and his master Mr. Titmouse
had presumed to intervene. What a crowd of
elegant women, many of them young and beautiful, (who
but such, to be sure, would have become, or been allowed
to become, pedestrians in the Park?) he encountered, as
he slowly sauntered on, all of them obsequiously attended
by brilliant beaux! Lords and ladies were here manifestly
as plentiful as plebeians in Oxford Street. What
an enchanted ground!&mdash;How delicious this soft crush
and flutter of aristocracy! Poor Titmouse felt at once
an intense pleasure, and a withering consciousness of his
utter insignificance. Many a sigh of dissatisfaction and
envy escaped him; yet he stepped along with a tolerably
assured air, looking everybody he met straight in the
face, and occasionally twirling about his little cane with
an air which seemed to say&mdash;"Whatever opinion <i>you</i>
may form of me, I have a very good opinion of myself."
Indeed, was he not as much a man&mdash;an Englishman&mdash;as
the best of them? What was the real difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
between Count Do-'em-all and Mr. Tittlebat Titmouse?
Only that the Count had dark hair and whiskers, and
owed more money than Mr. Titmouse's creditors could
be persuaded to allow <i>him</i> to owe! Would to Heaven&mdash;thought
Titmouse&mdash;that any <i>one</i> tailor would patronize
<i>him</i> as half a dozen had patronized the Count! If pretty
ladies of quality did not disdain a walking advertisement
of a few first-rate tailors, like the Count, why should they
turn up their noses at an assistant in an extensive wholesale
and retail establishment in Oxford Street, conversant
with the qualities and prices of the most beautiful articles
of female attire? Yet alas, they <i>did</i> so!&mdash;-- He sighed
heavily. Leaning against the railing in a studied attitude,
and eying wistfully each gay and fashionable
equipage, with its often lovely, and sometimes haughty
enclosure, as it rolled slowly past him, Mr. Titmouse
became more and more convinced of a great practical
truth, viz. that the only real distinction between mankind
was that effected by money. Want of money alone
had placed him in his present abject position. Abject
indeed! By the great folk, who were passing him on all
sides, he felt, well-dressed as he believed himself to be,
that he was no more noticed than as if he had been an
ant, a blue-bottle fly, or a black beetle! He looked, and
sighed&mdash;sighed, and looked&mdash;looked, and sighed again,
in a kind of agony of vain longing. While his only day
in the week for breathing fresh air, and appearing like a
gentleman in the world, was rapidly drawing to a close,
and he was beginning to think of returning to the dog-hole
he had crawled out of in the morning, and to the
shop for the rest of the week; the great, and gay, and
happy folk he was looking at, were thinking of driving
home to dress for their grand dinners, and to lay out
every kind of fine amusement for the ensuing week: and
that, moreover, was the sort of life they led every day in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the week! He heaved a profound sigh. At that moment
a superb cab, with a gentleman in it dressed in
great elegance, and with very keen dark eyes, and striking
nose and whiskers, came up with a cab of still more exquisite
structure and appointments, and at which Titmouse
gazed with unutterable feelings of envy&mdash;in which
sat a young man, evidently of consequence; very handsome,
with splendid mustaches; perfectly well-dressed;
holding the reins and whip gracefully in hands glistening
in straw-colored kid gloves&mdash;and between the two gentlemen
ensued the following low-toned colloquy, which
it were to be wished that every such sighing simpleton
(as Titmouse must, I fear, by this time appear to the
reader) could have overheard.</p>

<p>"Ah, Fitz!" said the former-mentioned gentleman to
the latter, who suddenly reddened when he perceived
who had addressed him. The manner of the speaker
was execrably familiar and presumptuous&mdash;but how could
the embarrassed <i>swell</i> help himself?&mdash;"When did you
return to town?"</p>

<p>"Last night only"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Enjoyed yourself, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well&mdash;but&mdash;I&mdash;suppose you"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sorry for it," interrupted the first speaker in a lower
tone, perceiving the vexation of his companion; "but
can't help it, you know."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow at nine. Monstrous sorry for it&mdash;'pon
my soul, you really must look sharp, Fitz, or the thing
won't go on much longer."</p>

<p>"Must it be, really?" inquired the other, biting his lips&mdash;at
that moment kissing his hand to a very beautiful girl,
who slowly passed him in a coroneted chariot&mdash;"must
it really be, Joe?" he repeated, turning towards his companion
a pale and bitterly chagrined countenance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poz, 'pon my life. Cage clean, however, and not very
full&mdash;just at present"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Would not <i>Wednesday</i>!"&mdash;inquired the other, leaning
forward towards the former speaker's cab, and whispering
with an air of intense earnestness. "The fact is,
I've engagements at C&mdash;&mdash;'s on Monday and Tuesday
nights with one or two country cousins, and I <i>may</i> be in
a condition&mdash;eh? you understand?"</p>

<p>His companion shook his head distrustfully.</p>

<p>"Upon my word and honor as a gentleman, it's the
fact!" said the other, in a low vehement tone.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;say Wednesday, nine o'clock, <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> You
understand? No mistake, Fitz!" replied his companion,
looking him steadily in the face as he spoke.</p>

<p>"None&mdash;honor!"&mdash;After a pause&mdash;"Who is it?"</p>

<p>His companion took a slip of paper out of his pocket,
and in a whisper read from it&mdash;"Cab, harness, &amp;c., £297, 10s."</p>

<p>"A villain! It's been of only three years' standing,"
interrupted the other, in an indignant mutter.</p>

<p>"Between ourselves, he <i>is</i> rather a sharp hand. Then,
I'm sorry to say there's a Detainer or two I have had a
hint of"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The swell uttered an execration which I dare not
convey to paper&mdash;his face distorted with an expression
of mingled disgust, vexation, and hatred; and adding,
"Wednesday&mdash;nine"&mdash;drove off, a picture of tranquil
enjoyment.</p>

<p>I need hardly say that <i>he</i> was a fashionable young
spendthrift, and the other a sheriff's officer of the first
water&mdash;the genteelest <i>beak</i> that ever was known or heard
of&mdash;who had been on the look-out for him several days,
and with whom the happy youngster was doomed to
spend some considerable time at a cheerful residence in
Chancery Lane, bleeding gold at every pore the while:&mdash;his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
only chance of avoiding which, was, as he had
truly hinted, an honorable attempt on the purses of two
hospitable country cousins, in the meanwhile, at C&mdash;&mdash;'s!
And if he did not succeed in that enterprise, so that he
<i>must</i> go to cage, he lost the only chance he had for some
time of securing an exemption from such annoyance, by
entering Parliament to protect the liberties of the people&mdash;an
eloquent and resolute champion of freedom in trade,
religion, and everything else; and an abolitionist of everything,
including, especially, negro slavery and imprisonment
for debt[<a href='#Note_2'>2</a>]&mdash;two execrable violations of the natural
rights of mankind.</p>

<p>But I have, for several minutes, lost sight of the
admiring Titmouse.</p>

<p>"Why," thought he, "am <i>I</i> thus spited by fortune?&mdash;The
only thing she's given <i>me</i> is&mdash;nothing!&mdash;<i>D&mdash;n
everything!</i>" exclaimed Mr. Titmouse aloud, at the same
time starting off, to the infinite astonishment of an old
peer, who had been for some minutes standing leaning
against the railing, close beside him; who was master of
a magnificent fortune, "with all appliances and means to
boot;" with a fine grown-up family, his eldest son and
heir having just gained a Double First, and promising
wonders; possessing many mansions in different parts of
England; a reputation for exquisite taste and accomplishment;
and being the representative of one of the oldest
families in England; but who at that moment loathed
everything and everybody, including himself, because
the minister had the day before intimated to him that he
could not give him a vacant ribbon, for which he had
applied, unless he could command two more votes in the
Lower House, and which at present his lordship saw no
earthly means of doing. Yes, the Earl of Cheviotdale
and Mr. Tittlebat Titmouse were both miserable men;
both had been hardly dealt with by fortune; both were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
greatly to be pitied; and both quitted the Park, about
the same time, with a decided misanthropic tendency.</p>

<p>Mr. Titmouse walked along Piccadilly with a truly
chopfallen and disconsolate air. He very nearly felt dissatisfied
even with his personal appearance! Dress as
he would, no one seemed to care a curse for him; and,
to his momentarily jaundiced eye, he seemed equipped
in only second-hand and shabby finery; and then he
was really such a <i>poor</i> devil!&mdash;Do not, however, let
the reader suppose that this was an unusual mood with
Mr. Titmouse. No such thing. Like the Irishman who
"married a wife for to make him <i>un-aisy</i>;" and also not
unlike the moth that <i>will</i> haunt the brightness which is
her destruction; so poor Titmouse, Sunday after Sunday,
dressed himself out as elaborately as he had done on
the present occasion, and then always betook himself to the
scene he had just again witnessed, and which had once
again excited only those feelings of envy, bitterness, and
despair, which I have been describing, and which, on
every such occasion, he experienced with, if possible,
increased intensity.</p>

<p>What to do with himself till it should be time to return
to his cheerless lodgings he did not exactly know;
so he loitered along at a snail's pace. He stood for some
time staring at the passengers, their luggage, and the
coaches they were ascending and alighting from, and
listening to the strange medley of coachmens', guards',
and porters' vociferations, and passengers' greetings and
leave-takings&mdash;always to be observed at the White Horse
Cellar. Then he passed along, till a street row, near the
Haymarket, attracted his attention and interested his
feelings; for it ended in a regular set-to between two
watermen attached to the adjoining coach-stand. Here
he conceived himself looking on with the easy air of a
swell; and the ordinary penalty (paying for his footing)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
was attempted to be exacted from him; but he had nothing
to be picked out of any of his pockets except that
under his very nose, and which contained his white handkerchief!
This over, he struck into Leicester Square,
where, (he was in luck that night,) hurrying up to another
crowd at the farther end, he found a man preaching with
infinite energy. Mr. Titmouse looked on, and listened
for two or three minutes with apparent interest; and
then, with a countenance in which pity struggled with
contempt, muttered, loud enough to be heard by all near
him, "poor devil!" and walked off. He had not proceeded
many steps, before it occurred to him that a
friend&mdash;one Robert Huckaback, much such another one
as himself&mdash;lived in one of the narrow, dingy streets in
the neighborhood. He determined to take the chances
of his being at home, and if so, of spending the remainder
of the evening with him. Huckaback's quarters were in
the same ambitious proximity to heaven as his own; the
only difference being, that they were a trifle cheaper and
larger. He answered the door himself, having only the
moment before returned from <i>his</i> Sunday's excursion,&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
the Jack Straw's Castle Tea-Gardens, at Highgate,
where, in company with several of his friends, he had
"spent a jolly afternoon." He ordered in a glass of
negus from the adjoining public-house, after some discussion,
which ended in an agreement that he should stand
treat that night, and Titmouse on the ensuing Sunday
night. As soon as the negus had arrived, accompanied
by two sea-biscuits, which looked so hard and hopeless
that they would have made the nerves thrill within the
teeth of him that meditated attempting to masticate them,
the candle was lit; Huckaback handed a cigar to his
friend; and both began to puff away, and chatter pleasantly
concerning the many events and scenes of the day.</p>

<p>"Anything stirring in to-day's 'Flash?'" inquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Titmouse, as his eye caught sight of a copy of that
able and interesting Sunday newspaper, the "<span class="smcap">Sunday
Flash</span>," which Huckaback had hired for the evening
from the news-shop on the ground-floor of his lodgings.</p>

<p>Mr. Huckaback removed his cigar from his mouth,
and holding it between the first and second fingers of his
right hand, in a knowing style, with closed eyes and inflated
cheeks, very slowly ejected the smoke which he
had last inhaled, and rose and got the paper from the
top of the drawers.</p>

<p>"Here's a mark of a beastly porter-pot that's been
set upon it, by all that's holy! It's been at the public-house!
Too bad of Mrs. Coggs to send it me up in this
state!" said he, handling it as though its touch were
contamination.&mdash;(He was to pay only a halfpenny for
the perusal of it.) "Faugh! how it stinks!"</p>

<p>"What a horrid beast she must be!" exclaimed Titmouse,
after, in like manner as his friend, expelling his
mouthful of smoke. "But, since better can't be had,
let's hear what news is in it. Demmee! it's the only
paper published, in my opinion, that's worth reading!&mdash;Any
fights astirring?"</p>

<p>"Haven't come to them yet; give a man <i>time</i>, Titty!"
replied Huckaback, fixing his feet on another chair, and
drawing the candle closer to the paper. "It says, by
the way, that the Duke of Dunderhead is certainly making
up to Mrs. Thumps, the rich cheesemonger's widow;&mdash;a
precious good hit that, isn't it? You know the
Duke's as poor as a rat!"</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>that's</i> no news. It's been in the papers for I
don't know how long. Egad, 't&nbsp;will quite set him up&mdash;and
no mistake. Seen the Duke ever?"</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;es! Oh, several times!" replied Huckaback.
This was a lie, and Huckaback knew that it was.</p>

<p>"Deuced good-looking, I suppose?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why&mdash;middling; I should say middling. Know
<i>some</i> that needn't fear to compare with
<i>him</i>&mdash;eh! Tit?"&mdash;and Huckaback winked archly at his friend,
meaning him, however, to consider the words as applicable
to the speaker.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha, ha!&mdash;a pretty joke! But come, that's a
good chap!&mdash;You can't be reading both of those two
sheets at once&mdash;give us the other sheet, and set the
candle right betwixt us!&mdash;Come, fair's the word among
<i>gents</i>, you know!"</p>

<p>Huckaback thus appealed to, did as his friend requested;
and the two gentlemen read and smoked for
some minutes in silence.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I shall spell over the advertisements now,"
said Titmouse, very emphatically; "there's a pretty lot
of them&mdash;and I've read everything else&mdash;(though precious
little there is, <i>here</i> besides!)&mdash;So, here goes!&mdash;One
<i>may</i> hear of a prime situation, you know&mdash;and I'm
quite sick of Tag-rag!"</p>

<p>Another interval of silence ensued. Huckaback was
deep in the ghastly but instructive details of a trial for
murder; and Titmouse, after having glanced listlessly
over the entertaining first sheet of advertisements, was
on the point of laying down his half of the paper, when
he suddenly started in his chair, turned very pale, and stammered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hollo!&mdash;hollo, Hucky!&mdash;Why"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Tit?&mdash;eh?" inquired Huckaback,
greatly astonished.</p>

<p>For a moment Titmouse made no answer, but, dropping
his cigar, fixed his eyes intently on the paper, which
began to rustle in his trembling hands. What occasioned
this outbreak, with its subsequent agitation, was the following
advertisement, which appeared in the most conspicuous
part of the "<span class="smcap">Sunday Flash</span>:"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Next of Kin</span>&mdash;Important.&mdash;The next of kin, if any such
there be, of <span class="smcap">Gabriel Tittlebat Titmouse</span>, formerly of
<span class="smcap">Whitehaven</span>, cordwainer, and who died somewhere about the year
1793, in London, may hear of something of the <span class="smcap">greatest possible
importance</span> to himself, or herself, or themselves, by immediately
communicating with Messrs. <span class="smcap">Quirk</span>, <span class="smcap">Gammon</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Snap</span>, Solicitors, Saffron Hill. No time is to be lost.
9th July 18&mdash;.&mdash;<i>The third advertisement.</i>"</p></div>

<p>"By George! Here <i>is</i> a go!" exclaimed Huckaback,
almost as much flustered as Titmouse over whose shoulder
he had hastily read the above paragraph.</p>

<p>"We aren't dreaming, Hucky&mdash;are we?" inquired
Titmouse, faintly, his eyes still glued to the newspaper.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;by George! Never was either of us fellows so
precious wide awake in our lives before! that I'll answer
for!" Titmouse sat still, and turned paler even than before.</p>

<p>"Read it up, Huck!&mdash;Let's hear how it <i>sounds</i>, and
then we shall believe it!" said he, handing the paper to
his friend.</p>

<p>Huckaback read it aloud.</p>

<p>"It sounds like something, don't it?" inquired Titmouse,
tremulously, his color a little returning.</p>

<p>"Uncommon!&mdash;If this isn't <i>something</i>, then there's
nothing in anything any more!" replied Huckaback,
solemnly, at the same time emphatically slapping the table.</p>

<p>"No!&mdash;'Pon my soul! but do you really think so?"
said Titmouse, seeking still further confirmation than he
had yet derived from his senses of sight and hearing.</p>

<p>"I do, by jingo!" repeated Huckaback&mdash;"What a go
it is!&mdash;Well, my poor old mother used to say, 'depend
on it, wonders never <i>will</i> cease;' and curse me if she ever
said a truer word!"</p>

<p>Titmouse again read over the advertisement; and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
picking up and relighting his fragment of cigar, puffed
earnestly in silence for some moments.</p>

<p>"Such things never happens to such a poor devil of a
chap as me!" exclaimed Huckaback, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> in the wind, I wonder?" muttered Titmouse.
"Who knows&mdash;hem!&mdash;who knows?&mdash;But now, <i>really</i>"&mdash;&mdash; he
paused, and once more read over the pregnant
paragraph.&mdash;"It can't&mdash;no, curse me, it <i>can't</i>
be"&mdash;&mdash; he added, looking very serious.</p>

<p>"What, Tit? <i>What</i> can't be?" interrupted Huckaback, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Why, I've been thinking&mdash;but what do <i>you</i> think,
eh?&mdash;it can't <i>hardly</i> be a cursed hoax of the chaps in
the premises at Tag-rag's?"</p>

<p>"Bo!&mdash;Is there any of 'em flush enough of money to
do the thing? And how should they think it would ever
come to be seen by you?&mdash;Then, besides, there isn't a
chap among them that could come up to the composing
a piece of composition like that&mdash;no, not for all a whole
year's salary&mdash;there isn't, by George! You and I
couldn't do it, and, of course, <i>they</i> couldn't!"</p>

<p>"Ah! I don't know," said Titmouse, doubtfully.
"But&mdash;honor!&mdash;do you really now think there's anything in it?"</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;I'm blowed if I don't, Tit!" was the sententious answer.</p>

<p>"Tol de rol, de rol, de rol, de rol&mdash;diddl'em&mdash;daddl'em&mdash;bang!"
almost shouted Titmouse, jumping up, snapping
his fingers, and dancing about in a wild ecstasy, which
lasted for nearly a minute.</p>

<p>"Give me your hand, Hucky," said he presently, almost
breathless. "If I <i>am</i> a made man&mdash;tol de rol, lol de rol,
lol de rol, lol!&mdash;you see, Huck!&mdash;if I don't give you
the handsomest breastpin you ever saw? No paste! real
diamond!&mdash;Hurrah! I will, by jingo!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Huckaback grasped and squeezed his hand. "We've
always been friends, Tit&mdash;haven't we?" said he,
affectionately.</p>

<p>"My room won't hold me to-night!" continued Titmouse;
"I'm sure it won't. I feel as if I was, as you
may say, swelling all over. I'll walk the streets all night:
I couldn't sleep a wink for the life of me! I'll walk
about till the shop opens. Oh, faugh! how nasty! Confound
the shop, and Tag-rag, and everything and everybody
in it! Thirty-five pounds a year? See if I won't
spend as much in cigars the first month!"</p>

<p>"Cigars! Is that your go? Now, <i>I</i> should take lessons
in boxing, to begin with. It's a deuced high thing, you
may depend upon it, and you can't be fit company for
swells without it, Tit! You can't, by Jove!"</p>

<p>"Whatever you like, whatever you like, Hucky!" cried
Titmouse&mdash;adding, in a sort of ecstasy, "I'm sorry to
say it, but how <i>precious</i> lucky that my father and mother's
dead, and that I'm an only child&mdash;too-ra-laddy, too-ra-laddy!"
Here he took such a sudden leap, that I am
sorry to say he split his trousers very awkwardly, and
that sobered him for a moment, while they made arrangements
for cobbling it up as well as might be,
with a needle and thread which Huckaback always
had by him.</p>

<p>"We're rather jumping in the dark a-bit, aren't we,
Tit?" inquired Huckaback, while his companion was
repairing the breach. "Let's look what it all means&mdash;here
it is." He read it all aloud again&mdash;"'<i>greatest
possible importance</i>!'&mdash;what <i>can it</i> mean? Why the
deuce couldn't they speak out plainly?"</p>

<p>"What! in a newspaper? Lord, Hucky! how many
Titmouses would start up on all sides, if there isn't some
already indeed! I wonder what '<i>greatest possible importance</i>'
can mean, now!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Some one's left you an awful lot of money, of course"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's too good to be true"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Or you may have made a <i>smite</i>; you a'n't such a
bad-looking fellow, when you're dressed as you are now&mdash;you
a'n't indeed, Titty!" Mr. Titmouse was quite
flustered with the mere supposition, and also looked as
sheepish as his features would admit of.</p>

<p>"E-e-e-eh, Hucky! how ve-ry silly you are!" he simpered.</p>

<p>"Or you may be found out heir to some great property,
and all that kind of thing.&mdash;But when do you intend to
go to Messrs. What's-their-name? I should say, the
sooner the better. Come, you've stitched them trousers
well enough, now; they'll hold you till you get home,
(you do brace up uncommon tight!) and I'd take off my
straps, if I was you. Why shouldn't we go to these gents
now? Ah, here they are&mdash;Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and
Snap, solicitors."</p>

<p>"I wonder if they're great men? Did you ever hear
of them before?"</p>

<p>"Haven't I! Their names is always in this same
paper; they are every day getting people off out of all
kinds of scrapes&mdash;they're the chaps <i>I</i> should nat'rally
go to if I anyhow got wrong&mdash;ahem!"</p>

<p>"But, my dear fellow&mdash;<i>Saffron Hill!</i>&mdash;Low that&mdash;devilish
low, 'pon my soul! Never was near it in my life."</p>

<p>"But they live there to be near the thieves. Lud, the
thieves couldn't do without 'em! But what's that to
you! You know 'a very dirty ugly toad has often got
a jewel in his belly,' so Shakspeare or some one says.
Isn't it enough for <i>you</i>, Tit, if they can make good
their advertisement? Let's off, Tit&mdash;let's off, I say;
for you mayn't be able to get there to-morrow&mdash;your employers!"&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"My employers! Do you think, Hucky, I'm going
back to business after this?"</p>

<p>"Come, come, Titty&mdash;not so fast&mdash;suppose it all
turns out moonshine, after all"&mdash;quoth Huckaback, seriously.</p>

<p>"Lord, but I <i>won't</i> suppose anything of the sort! It
makes me sick to think of nothing coming of it!&mdash;Let's
go off at once, and see what's to be done!"</p>

<p>So Huckaback put the newspaper into his pocket, blew
out the candle, and the two started on their important
errand. It was well that their means had been too
limited to allow of their indulging to a greater extent
than a glass of port-wine negus (that was the name under
which they had drunk the "<i>publican's</i> port"&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> a warm
sweetened decoction of oak bark, logwood shavings, and
a little brandy) between them; otherwise, excited as were
the feelings of each of them by the discovery of the
evening, they must in all probability have been guilty of
some piece of extravagance in the streets. As it was,
they talked very loudly as they went along, and in a
tone of conversation pitched perhaps a little too high
for their present circumstances, however in unison it
might be with the expected circumstances of <i>one</i> of them.</p>

<p>In due time they reached the residence of which they
were in search. It was a large house, greatly superior
to all its dingy neighbors; and on a bright brass plate,
a yard long at least, and a foot wide, stood the awe-inspiring
words, "<span class="smcap">Quirk, Gammon, &amp; Snap, Solicitors</span>."</p>

<p>"Now, Tit," whispered Huckaback, after they had
paused for a second or two&mdash;"now for it&mdash;pluck up a
sperrit&mdash;ring!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;'pon my life&mdash;I feel all of a sudden uncommon
funky&mdash;I think that last cigar of yours wasn't"&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stuff, Tit&mdash;ring! ring away! Faint heart never wins!"</p>

<p>"Well, it <i>must</i> be done: so&mdash;here goes at any rate!"
he replied; and with a short nervous jerk, he caused
a startling clatter within, which was so distinctly audible
without, that both of them instinctively <i>hemmed</i>, as if to
drown the noise which was so much greater than they
had expected. In a very few moments they heard some
one undoing the fastenings of the door, and the gentlemen
looked at one another with an expression of mingled
expectation and apprehension. A little old woman at
length, with a candle in her hand, retaining the heavy
door-chain in its fastening, peered round the edge of
the door at them.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she exclaimed crustily.</p>

<p>"Is this Messrs.&mdash;What is it, Huck?&mdash;Oh! Messrs.
Quirk &amp; Co.'s?" inquired Titmouse, tapping the end of
his cane against his chin, with a desperate effort to appear
at his ease.</p>

<p>"Why, where's your eyes?" she replied angrily, "I
should think you might have seen what was wrote on
this here plate&mdash;it's large enough, one should have
thought, to be read by them as <i>can</i> read&mdash;Is your's
Newgate business? Because if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We want&mdash;Give us the paper, Hucky"&mdash;he added,
addressing his companion, who produced it in a moment;
and Titmouse would have proceeded to possess the old
lady of all his little heart, when she cut him short by
saying snappishly&mdash;"They aren't none on 'em in; nor
never is on Sundays&mdash;so you'll just call to-morrow if
you wants 'em. What's your names?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Tittlebat Titmouse," answered that gentleman,
with a very particular emphasis on every syllable.</p>

<p>"Mr. <i>who</i>?" exclaimed the old woman, opening her
eyes very wide, and raising her hand to the back of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
ear. Mr. Titmouse repeated his name more loudly and distinctly.</p>

<p>"Tippetytippety&mdash;what's that?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" exclaimed Titmouse, peevishly; "I said,
Mr. Tit-el-bat Tit-mouse!&mdash;will that suit you?"</p>

<p>"Tick-a-tick-a-tick?&mdash;Well, gracious! if ever I heard
such a name. Oh!&mdash;I see!&mdash;you're making a fool
of me! Get off, or I'll call a constable in!&mdash;Get
along with you, you couple of jail-birds! Is this the way"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I tell you," interposed Mr. Huckaback, angrily,
"that this gentleman's name is Mr. Tittlebat Titmouse;
and you'd better take care what you're at, old woman,
for we've come on business of <i>wital consequence</i>!"</p>

<p>"I dare say it'll keep, then, till to-morrow," tartly
added the old woman.</p>

<p>The friends consulted for a moment, and then Titmouse
asked if he might come in and write a letter to
Messrs. Quirk and Co.</p>

<p>"No indeed!" said she; "how do I know who you
are? There's a public-house close by, where you may
write what you like, and bring it here, and they'll get it
the first thing in the morning. So that's what you may
take away with you!"&mdash;with which the complaisant
old janitrix shut the door in their faces.</p>

<p>"Huck, 'pon my life, I am afraid there's nothing in
it," said Titmouse, despondingly, to his friend&mdash;both of
them remaining rooted to the spot.</p>

<p>"Oudacious old toad!" muttered Huckaback, very indignantly.</p>

<p>"Hucky&mdash;I'm <i>sure</i> there's nothing in it!" exclaimed
Titmouse, after a long pause, looking earnestly at his
friend, hoping to draw from him a contrary opinion.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I own I don't half like the looks of it," replied
Huckaback, putting his newspaper into his pocket again;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
"but we'll try if we can't write a letter to sound 'em,
and so far take the old creature's advice. Here's the
public-house she told us of. Come, let's see what's to
be done!"</p>

<p>Titmouse, greatly depressed, followed his friend; and
they soon provided themselves with two glasses of stout,
and after a little difficulty, with implements for writing.
That they made good use of their time and materials, let
the following epistle prove. It was their joint composition,
and here is an exact copy of it:&mdash;</p>

<p>This perspicuous and truly elegant performance having
been thrice subjected to the critical examination of the
friends, (the paragraph concerning Huckaback having
been inserted at the instance of that gentleman, who
wished to be mixed up from the beginning with so promising
an affair,) was then folded up, and directed to
"Messrs. Quirk and Co.," a great straggling wet wafer
having been first put upon it. It was safely deposited,
a few minutes afterwards, with the old lady at Messrs.
Quirk, Gammon, and Snap's; and then the two West-End
gentlemen hastened away from that truly plebeian
part of the town! Under three different gas-lights did
they stop, take out the newspaper, and spell over the
advertisement; by which ingenious processes they at
length succeeded in satisfying themselves that there <i>was</i>
something in it&mdash;a fact of which, upon the old woman
shutting the door in their faces, it may be recollected
they had had grievous misgivings. They parted, however,
with a considerable abatement of the excitement with
which they had set out on their voyage of discovery.</p>

<p>Mr. Titmouse did not, on reaching his room, take off
and lay aside his precious Sunday apparel with his accustomed
care and deliberation. On the contrary, he
peeled it off, as it were, and threw himself on the bed as
quickly as possible, in order that he might calmly revolve
the immense event of the day in his little mind,
which it had agitated like a stone thrown into a stagnant
pool by the roadside. Oh, how restless was he!&mdash;not
more so could he have been had he lain between horse-hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
sheets. He repeatedly got up and walked about two
or three little steps, which were all that his room admitted
of. At the very first peep of daylight he started
out of bed, got out of his pocket the newspaper which
Huckaback had lent him, strove to decipher the advertisement,
and then sank into bed again&mdash;but not to
sleep, till four or five o'clock; having nevertheless to
rise at half-past six, to resume his detested duties at
Tag-rag and Co.'s, whose shop he assisted in opening
at seven o'clock, as usual. When he and his shopmates
were sitting together at breakfast, he could not for the
life of him help letting out a little, vaguely and mysteriously,
about "something that <i>might</i> happen in the
course of the day;" and thereby succeeded in satisfying
his experienced companions that he expected the visit of
a policeman, for some <i>row</i> he had been concerned in
over-night.&mdash;Well:&mdash;eight, nine, ten o'clock wore away
heavily, and nothing transpired, alas! to vary the monotonous
duties in which Mr. Titmouse was engaged; bale
after bale, and package after package, he took down and
put up again, at the bidding of pretty, capricious customers;
silk, satin, bombazines, crapes, muslins, ribbons,
gloves, he assisted in displaying, disposing of, or replacing
as usual; but it was clear that his powerful understanding
could no longer settle itself, as before, upon his responsible
and arduous duties. Every other minute he
cast a feverish furtive glance towards the door. He
almost dropped, at one time, as a postman crossed from
the opposite side of the street, as if to enter their shop&mdash;then
passing on immediately, however, to the next door.
Not a person, in short, entered the premises, whom he
did not scrutinize narrowly and anxiously, but in vain.
No&mdash;buying and selling was the order of the day, as
usual!&mdash;Eleven o'clock struck, and he sighed. "You
don't seem well," said a pretty young woman, to whom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
in a somewhat absent manner, he was exhibiting and describing
the qualities of some cambric. "Oh&mdash;ye&mdash;es,
uncommon!" he replied; "never better, ma'am, than
when so well employed!" accompanying the latter words
with what he conceived to be a very arch, but which
was in fact a very impudent, look at his fair customer.
At that moment a voice called out to him from the
farther end of the shop, near the door&mdash;"Titmouse! Wanted!"</p>

<p>"Coming!" he shouted, turning as white as the cambric
he held in his hands&mdash;which became suddenly cold;
while his heart went thump, thump, as he hastily exclaimed
to the astonished lady, "Excuse me, ma'am, if you
please&mdash;Jones," addressing the shopman next him, "will
you attend to this lady?" and he hastened whither he had
been called, amid a prevalent grin and "hem!" from his
companions on each side, as he passed along the shop, till
he reached the spot where stood the stranger who had inquired
for him. He was of a slight and gentlemanly figure,
above the average height. His countenance was very
striking: he was dressed with simplicity&mdash;somewhat carelessly
perhaps; and appeared somewhere about thirty-six
or thirty-seven years of age. He bowed slightly as Titmouse
approached him, and an air of very serious surprise
came over his expressive countenance.</p>

<p>"Mr. Titmouse?" he inquired blandly.</p>

<p>"Ye-e-s, sir, at your service," replied Titmouse, trembling
involuntarily all over. The stranger again slightly
inclined towards him, and&mdash;still more slightly&mdash;touched
his hat; fixing on him, at the same time, an inquisitive
penetrating eye, which really abashed, or rather perhaps
alarmed him.</p>

<p>"You left&mdash;you favored us by leaving&mdash;a note at our
office last night, sir, addressed to Messrs. Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap?" he inquired, lowering his voice to a whisper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir, hoping it was no"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pray, Mr. Titmouse, can we be alone for about five or
ten minutes?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;don't exactly know, <i>here</i>, sir; I'm afraid&mdash;against
the rules of the house&mdash;but I'll ask. Here <i>is</i>
Mr. Tag-rag.&mdash;May I step into the cloak-room with this
gentleman for a few minutes, sir?" he continued, addressing
his imperious employer, who, with a pen behind his
right ear, his left hand in his breeches pocket, and his
right hand impatiently tweedling about his watch-seals,
had followed Titmouse, on hearing him inquired for in
the manner I have described, and stood at a yard or two's
distance, eying the two with a truculent dissatisfied look,
wondering what on earth any one <i>could</i> want with one of
<i>his</i> young men.</p>

<p>As Mr. Tag-rag will be rather a prominent figure on
my canvas, I may as well here give the reader a slight
preparatory sketch of that gentleman. He was about
fifty-two years old; a great tyrant in his little way; a
compound of ignorance, selfishness, cant, and conceit. He
knew nothing on earth except the price of his goods, and
how to make the most of his business. He was of middle
size, with a tendency to corpulence; and almost invariably
wore a black coat and waistcoat, a white neck handkerchief
very primly tied, and gray trousers. He had a
dull, gray eye, with white eyelashes, and no eyebrows; a
forehead which seemed ashamed of his face, it retreated
so far and so abruptly back from it; his face was pretty
deeply pitted with the small-pox; his nose&mdash;or rather
semblance of a nose&mdash;consisted of two great nostrils looking
at you&mdash;as it were, impudently&mdash;out of the middle
of his face; there was a perfect level space from cheek-bone
to cheek-bone; his gray whiskers, trimly and closely
cut, came in points to each corner of his mouth, which
was large, shapeless, and sensual-looking. This may serve,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
for the present, to give you an idea of the man who had
contrived to excite towards himself the hatred and contempt
of everybody over whom he had any control&mdash;with
whom in fact he had anything to do.</p>

<p>"You know quite well, sir, we never allow anything of
the sort," was his short reply, in a very disagreeable tone
and manner, to Titmouse's modest request.</p>

<p>"May I beg the favor of a few minutes' private conversation
with Mr. Titmouse," said the stranger, politely, "on
a matter of the last importance to him? My name, sir,
is Gammon, and I am a solicitor of the firm of Quirk,
Gammon, and Snap"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, sir," answered Tag-rag, somewhat cowed by the
calm and gentlemanly, but at the same time decisive
manner of Mr. Gammon&mdash;"it's really very inconvenient,
and decidedly against the rules of the house, for any of
my young men to be absent on business of their own during
<i>my</i> business hours; but&mdash;I suppose&mdash;what must be
must be&mdash;I'll give him ten minutes&mdash;and he'd better
not stay longer," he subjoined fiercely&mdash;looking significantly
first at his watch, and then at Titmouse. "It's
only for the sake of my other young men, you know, sir.
In a large establishment like ours, we're obliged, you
know, sir," &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c., he added, in a low cringing tone,
deprecatory of the contemptuous air with which he <i>felt</i>
that Mr. Gammon was regarding him.</p>

<p>That gentleman, with a slight bow, and a sarcastic smile,
presently quitted the shop, accompanied by Titmouse, who
scarce knew whether his head or heels were uppermost.</p>

<p>"How far do you live from this place, Mr. Titmouse?"
inquired Mr. Gammon, as soon as they had got into
the street.</p>

<p>"Not four minutes' walk, sir; but&mdash;hem!"&mdash;he was
flustered at the idea of showing so eminent a person into
his wretched room&mdash;"Suppose we were to step into this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
tavern here, sir&mdash;I dare say they have a room at our service"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pray, allow me to ask, Mr. Titmouse&mdash;have you any
private papers&mdash;family writings, or things of that sort,
at your rooms?"</p>

<p>Titmouse seemed considering.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think I have, sir," he replied&mdash;"one or two&mdash;but
they're of no consequence."</p>

<p>"Are you a <i>judge</i> on that point, Mr. Titmouse?" inquired
Mr. Gammon, with a smile; "pray let us, my dear
sir, at once proceed to your rooms&mdash;time is very short
and valuable. I should vastly like to look at these same
insignificant papers of yours!"</p>

<p>In less than two minutes' further time, Mr. Gammon
was sitting at Titmouse's little rickety round table, at his
lodgings, with a sheet of paper before him, and a small
pencil-case in his hand, asking him a number of questions
concerning his birth and family connections, and taking
down his answers very carefully. Mr. Titmouse was surprised
at the gentleman's knowledge of the family history
of the Titmouses. As for papers, &amp;c., Mr. Titmouse succeeded
in producing four or five old letters and memoranda
from the bottom of his trunk, and one or two entries,
in faded ink, on the fly-leaf of a Bible of his father's, which
he did not recollect having opened before for very many
years, and of which said entries, till pressed on the subject
by Mr. Gammon, he had been hardly aware of even
the existence. With these several documents Mr. Gammon
was so much struck that he proposed to take them
away with him, for better and more leisurely examination,
and safer custody, at their office; but Mr. Titmouse significantly
hinted at his very recent acquaintance with Mr.
Gammon, who, he intimated, was at liberty to come and
make exact copies of them whenever he pleased, in his
(Mr. Titmouse's) presence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, certainly&mdash;yes," replied Mr. Gammon, slightly
coloring at the distrust implied by this observation; "I
applaud your caution, Mr. Titmouse. By all means keep
these documents, and most carefully; because, (I do not
say that they <i>are</i>,) but it is quite possible that they may
become rather valuable&mdash;to <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir; and now, hoping you'll excuse the
liberty," said Titmouse, with a very anxious air, "I should
most uncommonly like to know what all this means&mdash;what
is to turn up out of it all?"</p>

<p>"The law, my dear sir, is proverbially uncertain"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord! but the law can surely give one a <i>hint</i>"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>The law never hints</i>," interrupted Mr. Gammon, impressively,
with a bland smile.</p>

<p>"Well then, how did you come, sir, to know that
there ever was such a person as Mr. Gabriel Titmouse,
my father? And what can come from <i>him</i>, seeing he
was only a bit of a shoemaker&mdash;unless he's <i>heir</i> to something?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes&mdash;exactly; those are very interesting questions,
Mr. Titmouse&mdash;very!"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and them and many more I was going to
ask long ago, but I saw you were"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, I perceive that we have positively been absent
from your place of business nearly an hour&mdash;your employers
will be getting rather impatient."</p>

<p>"Meaning no offence, sir&mdash;bother <i>their</i> impatience!
<i>I'm</i> impatient, I assure you, to know what all this
means. Come, sir, 'pon my life I've told <i>you</i> everything!
It isn't quite fair!"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, you see, Mr. Titmouse," said Gammon,
with an agreeable smile&mdash;(it was that smile of his
which had been the making of Mr. Gammon)&mdash;"it is only
candid in me to acknowledge that your curiosity is perfectly
reasonable, and your frankness very obliging; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
I see no difficulty in admitting at once, that <i>I have</i> had
a&mdash;motive"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;and all that&mdash;<i>I</i> know, sir,"&mdash;hastily interrupted
Titmouse, but without irritating or disturbing the
placid speaker.</p>

<p>"And that we waited with some anxiety for the result
of our advertisement."</p>

<p>"Ah, you can't escape from <i>that</i>, you know, sir!" interposed
Titmouse, with a confident air.</p>

<p>"But it is a maxim with us, my dear sir, never to be
premature in anything, especially when it may be&mdash;very
prejudicial; you've really no idea, my dear Mr. Titmouse,
of the world of mischief that is often done by precipitancy
in legal matters; and in the present stage of the
business&mdash;the <i>present</i> stage, my dear sir&mdash;I really do
see it necessary not to&mdash;do anything premature, and
without consulting my partners."</p>

<p>"Lord, sir!" exclaimed Titmouse, getting more and
more irritated and impatient as he reflected on the length
of his absence from Tag-rag &amp; Co.'s.</p>

<p>"I quite feel for your anxiety&mdash;so perfectly natural"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, dear sir! if you'd only tell me the <i>least bit</i>"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"If, my dear sir, I were to disclose just now the exact
object we had in inserting that advertisement in the papers"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"How did you come to know of it at all, sir? Come,
there can't be any harm in <i>that</i> anyhow"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not the least, my dear sir. It was in the course of
business&mdash;in the course of business."</p>

<p>"Is it money that's been left me&mdash;or&mdash;anything of
that sort?"</p>

<p>"It quite pains me, I assure you, Mr. Titmouse, to
suppose that our having put this advertisement into the
papers may have misled you, and excited false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
hopes&mdash;I think, by the way"&mdash;added Gammon, suddenly, as
something occurred to him of their previous conversation,
which he was not quite sure of&mdash;"you told me that that
Bible had been given you by your father."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir! yes&mdash;- no doubt of it; surely <i>that</i> can't
signify, seeing he's dead, and I'm his only son?" asked
Titmouse, quickly and eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh, 'tis only a circumstance&mdash;a mere circumstance;
but in business, you know, Mr. Titmouse, every little
helps&mdash;and you really, by the way, have no recollection
of your mother, Mr. Titmouse?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I said so! And&mdash;meaning no offence, sir&mdash;I
can't abide being put off in this kind of way,&mdash;I
must own!&mdash;See what I have told you&mdash;you've told
<i>me</i> nothing at all. I hope you haven't been only making
me a cat's-paw of? 'Pon my soul, I <i>hate</i> being made
a cat's-paw of, sir!"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, Mr. Titmouse! how can you imagine
it? Matters in some degree connected with one or two
former members of your family, are at this moment the
object of some little of our anxiety"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not meaning it rudely, sir&mdash;please to tell me at
once, plainly, am I to be the better for anything you're
now about, or was that advertisement all fudge?"</p>

<p>"That may or may not be, sir," answered Mr. Gammon,
in the same imperturbable manner, drawing on his gloves,
and rising from his chair. "In justice to yourself, and
other parties concerned"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! is anybody to <i>share</i> in it?" exclaimed Titmouse, alarmedly.</p>

<p>"I am sure," said Gammon, smiling, "that you will give
us credit for consulting your best interests, if they should
prove to be in any degree concerned in our present inquiries!
We should, in that event, sincerely desire to
advance them. But&mdash;it is <i>really</i>," looking at his watch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
"upwards of an hour since we quitted your place of
business&mdash;I fear I shall get into disgrace with that
respectable gentleman, your employer. Will you favor
us with a call at our office to-morrow night, when the
business of the day is over? When do you quit at night?"</p>

<p>"About half-past nine o'clock, sir; but really&mdash;to-morrow
night! Couldn't I come to-night, sir?"</p>

<p>"Not to-night, I fear, my dear sir. We have a very
important engagement. Let us say to-morrow night, at
a quarter past ten&mdash;shall we say that hour?" inquired
Mr. Gammon, with an imperative smile.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, if not before&mdash;yes&mdash;I'll be with you.
But I <i>must</i> say"&mdash;&mdash; quoth Titmouse, with a sulky
disconcerted air.</p>

<p>"Good-day, Mr. Titmouse," said Mr. Gammon&mdash;they
were by this time in Oxford Street again.&mdash;"Good-day,
my dear sir&mdash;good-day&mdash;to-morrow night, as soon after
ten as possible&mdash;eh? Good-by."</p>

<p>This was all that Mr. Titmouse could get out of Mr.
Gammon, who, hailing a coach off the stand beside them,
got in, and it was soon making its way eastward. What
a miserable mixture of doubts, hopes, and fears, had he
left Titmouse! He felt as if he were a squeezed orange;
he had told everything he knew about himself, and got
nothing in return out of the smooth, imperturbable, impenetrable
Mr. Gammon, but empty civilities.&mdash;"Lord,
Lord!" thought Titmouse, as Mr. Gammon's coach turned
the corner; "what would I give to know half about it
that that gent knows! But Mr. Tag-rag! by Jove! what
<i>will</i> he say? It's struck twelve. I've been more than
an hour away&mdash;and he gave me ten minutes! Sha'n't
I catch it?"</p>

<p>And he did. Almost the very first person whom he
met, on entering the shop, was his respected employer;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
who, plucking his watch out of his fob, and looking furiously
at it, motioned the trembling Titmouse to follow
him to the farther end of the long shop, where there
happened to be then no customers.</p>

<p>"Is this your ten minutes, sir, eh?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where may you have been, sir, all this while?"</p>

<p>"With that gentleman, sir, and I really did not know"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You didn't know, sir! Who cares what you know,
or don't know? <i>This</i>, at any rate, you know&mdash;that you
ought to have been back fifty-five minutes ago, sir. You
do, sir! Isn't your time my property, sir? Don't I pay
for it, sir? An hour!&mdash;in the middle of the day! I've
not had such a thing happen this five years! I'll stop it
out of your salary, sir."</p>

<p>Titmouse did not attempt to interrupt him.</p>

<p>"And pray what have you been gossiping about, sir, in
this disgraceful manner?"</p>

<p>"Something that he wanted to say to me, sir."</p>

<p>"You low puppy!&mdash;do you suppose I don't see your
impertinence? I <i>insist</i>, sir, on knowing what all this gossiping
with that fellow has been about?"</p>

<p>"Then you <i>won't</i> know, sir, that's flat!" replied Titmouse,
doggedly; returning to his usual station behind
the counter.</p>

<p>"I <i>sha'n't</i>!!" exclaimed Mr. Tag-rag, almost aghast
at the presumption of his inferior.</p>

<p>"No, sir, you <i>sha'n't</i> know a single word about it."</p>

<p>"Sha'n't know a single word about it! Vastly good,
sir!!&mdash;Do you know whom you're talking to, sir? Do
you really know in whose presence you are, sir?" inquired
Mr. Tag-rag, nearly trembling with rage.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tag-rag, I presume, of the firm of Tag-rag and
Co.," replied Titmouse, looking him full in the face.&mdash;One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
or two of his companions near him, almost turned
pale at the audacity he was displaying.</p>

<p>"And who are <i>you</i>, sir, that dare to presume to bandy
words with <span class="smcap">me</span>, sir?" inquired Tag-rag, his deeply pitted
face having turned quite white, and his whole body quivering
with rage.</p>

<p>"Tittlebat Titmouse, at your service," was the answer,
in a glib tone, and with a sufficiently saucy air; for Titmouse
then felt that he had passed the Rubicon.</p>

<p>"You heard that, I hope?" inquired Tag-rag, with
forced calmness, of a pale-faced young man, the nearest
to him.</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;es, sir," was the meekly reluctant answer.</p>

<p>"This day month you leave, sir!" said Mr. Tag-rag,
solemnly&mdash;as if conscious that he was passing a sort of
sentence of death upon the presumptuous delinquent.</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Tag-rag&mdash;anything that pleases you
pleases your humble servant. I <i>will</i> go this day month,
and welcome&mdash;I've long wished&mdash;and now, p'r'aps," he
added significantly&mdash;"it's rather convenient than otherwise"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then you <i>sha'n't</i> leave, sir," said Tag-rag, furiously.</p>

<p>"But I will, sir. You've given me warning; and, if
you haven't, now I give <i>you</i> warning," replied Titmouse;
turning, however, very pale, and experiencing a certain
sudden sinking of the heart&mdash;for this was a serious and
most unlooked-for event, and for a while put out of his
head all the agitating thoughts of the last few hours.
Poor Titmouse had enough to bear&mdash;what with the delicate
raillery and banter of his refined companions for the
rest of the day, find the galling tyranny of Mr. Tag-rag,
(who dogged him about all day, setting him about the
most menial and troublesome offices he could, and constantly
saying mortifying things to him before customers,)
and the state of miserable suspense in which Mr. Gammon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
had thought fit to leave him; I say that surely all this
was enough for him to bear without having to encounter
at night, as he did, on his return to his lodgings, his blustering
landlady, who vowed that if she sold him out and
out she would be put off no longer&mdash;and his pertinacious
and melancholy tailor, who, with sallow unshaven
face, told him of five children at home, all ill of the small-pox,
and his wife in an hospital&mdash;and he <i>implored</i> a payment
on account. This sufferer succeeded in squeezing
out of Titmouse seven shillings on account, and his landlady
extorted ten; which staved off a distress&mdash;direful
word!&mdash;for some week or two longer; and so they left
him in the possession of eight shillings or so, to last till
next quarter-day&mdash;six weeks off! He sighed heavily,
barred his door, and sat down opposite his little table,
on which was nothing but a solitary thin candle, and on
which his eyes rested unconsciously, till the stench of it,
burning right down into the socket, roused him from his
wretched revery. Then he unlocked his box, and took
out his Bible and the papers which had been produced to
Mr. Gammon, and gazed at them with intense but useless
scrutiny. Unable to conjecture what bearing they could
have upon himself or his fortunes, he hastily replaced them
in his box, threw off his clothes, and flung himself on his
bed, to pass a far more dismal night than he had known
for years.</p>

<p>He ran the gantlet at Messrs. Tag-rag and Co.'s all
Tuesday as he had done on the day preceding. One
should have supposed that when his companions beheld
him persecuted by their common tyrant, whom they all
equally hated, they would have made common cause with
their suffering companion, or at all events given no countenance
to his persecution; yet it was far otherwise.
Without stopping to analyze the feeling which produced
it, (and which the moderately reflective reader may easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
analyze for himself if so disposed,) I am grieved to have
to say, that when all the young men saw that Tag-rag
would be gratified by their <i>cutting</i> poor Titmouse, who,
with all his little vanities, fooleries, and even selfishness,
had never personally offended or injured any of them&mdash;they
did cut him; and, when Tag-rag observed it, his miserable
mind was unspeakably gratified with what they had
done: and he spoke to all of them with unusual blandness;
to the sinner, Titmouse, with augmented bitterness
and sternness.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>A few minutes after ten o'clock that night, a gentle ringing
at the bell of Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap's
office, announced the arrival of poor Titmouse. The door
was quickly opened by a very fashionably dressed clerk,
who seemed in the act of quitting for the night.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;Mr. Titmouse, I presume?" he inquired, with
a kind of deference in his manner to which Titmouse had
never been accustomed.</p>

<p>"The same, sir&mdash;Tittlebat Titmouse."</p>

<p>"Oh! allow me, sir, to show you in to Messrs. Quirk,
Gammon, and Snap; I know they're expecting to see
you. It's not often they're here so late! Walk in,
sir"&mdash;&mdash; With this he led the way to an inner room,
and opening a green-baize door in the farther side of it,
announced and showed in Mr. Titmouse, and left him&mdash;sufficiently
flustered. Three gentlemen were sitting at a
large table, on which he saw, by the strong but circumscribed
light of two shaded candlesticks, were lying a
great number of papers and parchments. The three gentlemen
rose when he entered, Mr. Quirk and Mr. Snap
involuntarily starting on first catching sight of the figure
of Titmouse: Mr. Gammon came and shook hands
with him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Titmouse," said he, with a very polite air, "let
me introduce you to Mr. Quirk"&mdash;(This was the senior
partner, a short, stout elderly gentleman, dressed in
black, with a shining bald crown fringed with white hair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and sharp black eyes, and who looked very earnestly, nay,
with even a kind of dismay, at him)&mdash;"and Mr. Snap"&mdash;(This
was the junior partner, having recently been
promoted to be such after ten years' service in the office,
as managing clerk: he was about thirty, particularly well
dressed, slight, active, and with a face like a terrier&mdash;<i>so</i>
hard, sharp, and wiry!) Of Mr. Gammon himself, I have
already given the reader a slight notion. He appeared
altogether a different style of person from both his partners.
He was of most gentlemanly person and bearing&mdash;and
at once acute, cautious, and insinuating&mdash;with a
certain something about the eye, which had from the first
made Titmouse feel uneasy on looking at him.</p>

<p>"A seat, sir," said Mr. Quirk, rising, and placing a chair
for him, on which he sat down, they resuming theirs.</p>

<p>"You are punctual, Mr. Titmouse!" exclaimed Mr.
Gammon, kindly; "more so than, I fear, you were yesterday,
after our long interview, eh? Pray what did
that worthy person, Mr. Rag-bag&mdash;or whatever his name
is&mdash;say on your return?"</p>

<p>"Say, gents?"&mdash;(he tried to clear his throat, for he
spoke somewhat more thickly, and his heart beat more
perceptibly than usual)&mdash;"Meaning no offence&mdash;I'm
ruined by it, and no mistake."</p>

<p>"Ruined! I'm sorry to hear it," interposed Mr. Gammon,
with a concerned air.</p>

<p>"I am, indeed, sir. Such a towering rage as he has
been in ever since; and he's given me warning to go on
the 10th of next month." He thought he observed a
faint smile flit over the faces of all three. "He has, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Dear me, Mr. Titmouse!&mdash;Did he allege any reason
for dismissing you?" keenly inquired Mr. Quirk.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What might it have been?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stopping out longer than I was allowed, and refusing
to tell him what this gentleman and I had been talking about."</p>

<p>"Don't think that'll do; sure it won't!" briskly exclaimed
Mr. Snap; "no just cause of dismissal that," and
he jumped up, whisked down a book from the shelves
behind him, and eagerly turned over the leaves.</p>

<p>"Never mind that now, Mr. Snap," said Mr. Quirk,
rather petulantly; "surely we have other matters to
talk about to-night!"</p>

<p>"Asking pardon, sir, but I think it <i>does</i> matter to me,
sir," interposed Titmouse; "for on the 10th of next
month I'm a beggar&mdash;being next door to it <i>now</i>."</p>

<p>"Not quite, we trust," said Mr. Gammon, with a
benignant smile.</p>

<p>"But Mr. Tag-rag said he'd make me as good as one."</p>

<p>"That's evidence to show malice," again eagerly interjected
Mr. Snap, who was a second time tartly rebuffed
by Mr. Quirk; even Mr. Gammon turning towards him
with a surprised&mdash;"Really, Mr. Snap!"</p>

<p>"So Mr. Tag-rag said he'd make you a beggar?" inquired
Mr. Quirk.</p>

<p>"He vowed he would, sir!&mdash;He did, as true as the
gospel, sir!"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Mr. Quirk and Mr. Gammon&mdash;but
such a laugh!&mdash;not careless or hearty, but subdued,
and with a dash of deference in it. "Well&mdash;it
perhaps <i>may</i> not signify much, by that time;" said Mr.
Quirk, and laughed again, followed by the soft laugh of
Mr. Gammon, and a kind of sharp quick sound, like a
bark, from Mr. Snap.</p>

<p>"But, gents, you'll excuse me if I say I think it <i>does</i>
signify to <i>me</i>, and a'n't any laughing matter, by any
means!" quoth Titmouse, earnestly, and coloring with
anger. "Without being rude, I'd rather come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
business, if there's any to be done, without so much laughing
at one."</p>

<p>"Laughing at you! my dear sir,&mdash;no, no!" exclaimed
all three in a breath&mdash;"laughing <i>with</i> you," said Mr.
Quirk!&mdash;"By the time you mention, you may perhaps
be able to laugh at Mr. Rag-bag, and everybody else, for"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>[&mdash;"No use mincing matters?" he whispered, in a
low tone, to Mr. Gammon, who nodded, but in apparently
very reluctant acquiescence, and fixed his eyes earnestly
on Titmouse.]</p>

<p>"I really think we are warranted, sir, in preparing you
to expect by that time&mdash;that is, you will understand, sir,
if our efforts are successful in your behalf, and if you
yield yourself implicitly in all things to our
guidance&mdash;<i>that is absolutely essential</i>&mdash;a prospect&mdash;we say at
present, you will observe, <i>only</i> a prospect&mdash;of a surprising
and splendid change in your circumstances!" Titmouse
began to tremble violently, his heart beat rapidly, and his
hands were bedewed with a cold moisture.</p>

<p>"I hear, gents," said he, thickly; and he also heard a
faint ringing in his ears.</p>

<p>"It's not impossible, sir, in plain English," continued
Mr. Quirk, himself growing a little excited with the important
communication which trembled on the tip of his
tongue, "that you may at no distant time (if you really
turn out to be the person we are in search of) be put into
possession of an estate of somewhere about Ten Thousand a-year"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The words seemed to have struck Titmouse blind&mdash;as
he saw nothing for some moments; then everything appeared
to be swimming around him, and he felt a sort of
faintness or sickness stealing over him. They had hardly
been prepared for their communication's affecting their
little visitor so powerfully. Mr. Snap hastened out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in again, with a glass of water; and the earnest attentions
of the three soon restored Mr. Titmouse to his senses. It
was a good while, however, before he could appreciate
the little conversation which they now and then addressed
to him, or estimate the full importance of the astounding
intelligence which Mr. Quirk had just communicated,
"Beg pardon&mdash;but may I make free to ask for a little
brandy and cold water, gents? I feel all over in a kind
of tremble," said he, some little time afterwards.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;by all means, Mr. Titmouse," replied Mr.
Quirk&mdash;"Mr. Snap, will you be kind enough to order
Betty to bring in a glass of cold brandy and water from
the Jolly Thieves, next door?"&mdash;Snap shot out, gave
the order, and returned in a trice. The old woman in
a few minutes' time followed, with a large tumbler of
dark brandy and water, quite hot, for which Mr. Gammon
apologized, but Mr. Titmouse said he preferred it so&mdash;and
soon addressed himself to the inspiriting mixture.
It quickly manifested its influence, reassuring him wonderfully.
As he sat sipping it, Messrs. Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap being engaged in an earnest conversation, of
which he could not comprehend a word, he had leisure to
look about him, and observed that there was lying before
them a large sheet of paper, at which they all of them
often and earnestly looked, filled with marks, so&mdash;</p>
<p style='text-align:center;'>
<img src='images/pg051.png' width='200'
title='tree diagram' alt='tree diagram' />
</p>
<p>
with writing at the ends of each of them, and round and
square figures. When he saw them all bending over
and scrutinizing this mysterious object, it puzzled him
(and many a better head than his has a pedigree puzzled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
before) sorely, and he began to suspect it was a sort of
conjuring paper!&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope, gents, that paper's all right&mdash;eh?" said he,
supported by the brandy, which he had nearly finished.
They turned towards him with a smile of momentary
surprise, and then&mdash;</p>

<p>"We hope so&mdash;a vast deal depends on it," said Mr.
Quirk, looking over his glasses at Titmouse. Now what
<i>he</i> had hinted at, as far as he could venture to do so, was
a thought that glanced across his as yet unsettled brain,
that there might have been invoked more than <i>mere
earthly assistance</i>; but he prudently pressed the matter
no farther&mdash;that was all Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and
Snap's look-out; <i>he</i> had been no party to anything of
the sort, nor would he knowingly. He also observed the
same sheets of paper written all over, which Mr. Gammon
had filled up at his (Titmouse's) room, the night before;
and several new, and old-looking, papers and parchments.
Sometimes they addressed questions to him, but found it
somewhat difficult to keep his attention up to anything
that was said to him for the wild visions which were
chasing one another through his heated brain; the passage
of which said visions was not a little accelerated by
the large tumbler of brandy and water which he had just taken.</p>

<p>"Then, in point of fact," said Mr. Quirk, as Messrs.
Gammon and Snap simultaneously sat down, after having
been for some time standing poring over the paper before
Mr. Quirk. "This Tittlebat Titmouse's title must have
accrued in 18&mdash;. That's the point&mdash;eh, Gammon?"</p>

<p>"Precisely so," said Mr. Gammon, calmly.</p>

<p>"To be sure," confidently added Snap; who having
devoted himself exclusively all his life to the sharpest
practice of the criminal law, knew about as much of real
property law as a snipe&mdash;but it would not have done to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
appear ignorant, or taking no part in the matter, in the
presence of the heir-at-law, and the future great client
of the House.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Titmouse," at length said Mr. Quirk, with a
sort of grunt, laying aside his glasses&mdash;"if <i>you</i> turn out
to be the Titmouse we have been speaking of, you are
likely, through our immense exertions, to become one
of the luckiest men that ever lived! We may be mistaken,
but it appears to us that we shall by and by be
able to put you into possession of a very fine estate in
Yorkshire, worth some £10,000 or £12,000 a-year at
the least!"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;don't&mdash;say&mdash;so!" exclaimed Titmouse, elevating
his hands and opening his eyes with amazement&mdash;"Oh,
gents, I do believe we're all dreaming! Is it all
true, indeed?"</p>

<p>"It is, Mr. Titmouse&mdash;and we are very proud and
happy indeed to be the honored instruments of establishing
your rights, my dear sir," said Mr. Gammon, in a
most impressive manner.</p>

<p>"Then all the money that's been spent this ten or
twelve years has been <i>my</i> money, has it?"</p>

<p>"<i>If</i> we are right, it is undoubtedly as you say," answered
Mr. Quirk, giving a quick apprehensive glance at
Mr. Gammon.</p>

<p>"Then there'll be a jolly reckoning for some one,
shortly&mdash;eh? My stars!"</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Titmouse," said Mr. Gammon, gravely,
"you have no more than a just regard for your own
interests. There <i>will</i> be a reckoning, and a very terrible
one ere long, for somebody&mdash;but we've a vast deal to
go through, and a vast deal of money to be spent, before
we come to discuss <i>that</i> matter! Only let us have the
unspeakable happiness of seeing you once fairly in possession
of your estates, and our office shall know no rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
till you have got all you may be entitled to&mdash;even to
the uttermost farthing!"</p>

<p>"Oh, never fear our letting them rest!" said Mr.
Quirk, judiciously accommodating himself to the taste
and apprehension of his excited auditor&mdash;"Those that
must give up the goose, must give up the giblets also&mdash;ha,
ha, ha!" Messrs. Gammon and Snap echoed the
laugh, duly tickled with the joke of the head of the firm.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Mr. Titmouse, immensely excited
by the conjoint influence of the brandy, and the
news of the night; "capital! capital! hurrah! Such
goings on there will be! You're all of the right sort,
gents, I see! 'Pon my life, law for ever! There's <i>nothing</i>
like it! Let's all shake hands, gents! Come, if you
please, all together! all friends to-night!" And the
little fellow grasped each of the three readily-proffered
right hands of Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, with
an energy that was likely to make all the high contracting
parties to that quadruple alliance, remember its ratification.</p>

<p>"And is it all a <i>ready-money</i> affair, gents?&mdash;or <i>rent</i>,
and all <i>that</i> kind of thing?" he inquired, after many
eloquent expressions of delight.</p>

<p>"Why, almost entirely the latter," answered Mr. Quirk,
"except the accumulations."</p>

<p>"Then, 'pon my soul&mdash;I'm a great landlord, am I?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, my dear Mr. Titmouse, you are&mdash;(that is,
unless we have made a blunder such as&mdash;I will say&mdash;our
house is not <i>often</i> in the habit of making)&mdash;and have
two very fine houses, one in town and the other in the country."</p>

<p>"Capital! delightful! I'll live in both of them&mdash;we'll
have <i>such</i> goings on!&mdash;And is it <i>quite</i> up to the
mark of £10,000 a-year?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"We really entertain no doubt at present that it is"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And such as that I can spend all of it, every year?"</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;no doubt of it&mdash;not the least. The
rents are paid with most exemplary punctuality&mdash;at
least," added Mr. Gammon, with a captivating, an irresistible
smile, and taking him affectionately by the hand&mdash;"at
least they <i>will</i> be, as soon as we have them fairly
in <i>our</i> management."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>you're</i> to get it all in for me, are you?" he inquired
briskly. The three partners bowed, with the
most deprecatingly-disinterested air in the world; intimating
that, for <i>his</i> sake, they were ready to take upon
themselves even <i>that</i> troublesome responsibility.</p>

<p>"Capital! couldn't be better! couldn't be better!
Ah, ha, ha&mdash;you've catched the goose, and must bring
me its eggs. Ah, ha, ha! a touch in <i>your</i> line, old gent!"
said he, slapping Mr. Quirk's knee.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! excellent! ah, ha, ha!" laughed the
three partners at the wit of their new client. Mr. Titmouse
joined them, and snapped his fingers in the air.
Then he added suddenly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lord&mdash;by the way&mdash;I've just thought of Tag-rag
and Company's&mdash;I seem as if I hadn't seen or heard of
those gents for Lord knows how long! Only fancy old
Tag-rag making me a beggar on the 10th of next month&mdash;ha,
ha, ha!&mdash;I sha'n't see <i>that</i> infernal hole any
more, anyhow!"</p>

<p>["There!" whispered Mr. Gammon, suddenly and
apprehensively, in the ear of Mr. Quirk, "you hear that?
A little wretch! We have been perfectly insane in going
so far already with him! Is not this what I predicted?"&mdash;"I
don't care," said Mr. Quirk, stubbornly. "Who
first found it out, Mr. Gammon? and who's to be at the
expense and responsibility? Pshaw! I know what I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
about&mdash;<i>I'll</i> make him knuckle down&mdash;never fear me!
Caleb Quirk a'n't a man to be trifled with!"]</p>

<p>"<i>That</i>," continued Titmouse, snapping his fingers with
an air of defiance&mdash;"for Mr. Tag-rag! <i>That</i> for Mother
Squallop&mdash;Ah, ha, gents! It won't do to go back to
that&mdash;eugh!&mdash;eh? will it?&mdash;you know what I mean!
Fancy Mr. Tittlebat Titmouse&mdash;or Mr. Tittlebat Titmouse,
<i>Esquire</i>&mdash;standing behind"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The partners looked rather blank at this unexpected sally.</p>

<p>"We would venture to suggest, Mr. Titmouse," said
Mr. Gammon, seriously, "the <i>absolute necessity</i> there is
for everything on your part, and our parts, to go on as
quietly as before, for a little time to come: to be safe
and successful, my dear sir, we must be very&mdash;very
<i>secret</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see, gents! I see; mum&mdash;mum's the word, for
the present! But, I <i>must</i> say, if there is any one whom I
want to hear of it, sooner than another, it's"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Rag-bag and Co., I suppose! ha, ha, ha!" interrupted
Mr. Gammon, his partners echoing his gentle laugh.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! Cuss the cats&mdash;that's it&mdash;ha, ha,
ha!" echoed Mr. Titmouse; who, getting up out of his
chair, could not resist capering to and fro, sticking his
hands on his hips, in something of the attitude of a
hornpipe dancer, whistling and humming by turns,
and indulging in various other wild antics.</p>

<p>"And now, gents&mdash;excuse me, but, to do a bit of business&mdash;when
am I to <i>begin</i> scattering the shiners, eh?"
he inquired, interrupting a low-toned, but somewhat
vehement conversation, between the two senior partners;
while Snap sat silently eying him like a terrier a rat
coming within his reach!</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, sir!" replied Mr. Gammon, rather
coldly, "very&mdash;considerable&mdash;delay is unavoidable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
All we have done, as yet, is to discover that, as far as we
are advised, and can judge, you will turn out to be the
right owner; but&mdash;as we've already intimated&mdash;very
extensive and expensive operations must be immediately
commenced, before you can be put into possession.
There are some who won't be persuaded to <i>part</i> with
£10,000 a-year, Mr. Titmouse, for the mere asking!"
added Mr. Gammon, with an anxious and bitter smile.</p>

<p>"The devil there are! <i>Who</i> are they that want to keep
me any longer out of what's my own?&mdash;what's justly
mine? Eh? I want to know! Haven't they kept me
out long enough?&mdash;hang 'em! Put 'em in prison directly&mdash;don't
spare 'em&mdash;the villains!"</p>

<p>"They'll probably, ere long, find their way in that direction&mdash;for
how," replied Mr. Quirk, "he's ever to
make up, poor devil, the mesne profits"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Mean</i> profits?&mdash;is that all you call them, gents?
'Pon my life, it's rogue's money&mdash;villain's profits! So
don't spare him&mdash;d&mdash;n him!&mdash;he's robbed the fatherless,
which I am, and an orphan. Keep me out of what's
mine, indeed! Curse me if he shall, though!"</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Titmouse," said Gammon, very gravely,
"we are getting on too fast&mdash;dreadfully too fast. It will
never do, matters of such immense importance as these
cannot be hurried on, or talked of, in this way"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I like that, sir!&mdash;I do, by Jove!"&mdash;exclaimed Titmouse,
scornfully.</p>

<p>"You will really, if you go on in this wild way, Mr.
Titmouse, make us regret the trouble we have taken in
the affair, and especially the promptness with which we
have communicated to you the extent of your <i>possible</i>
good fortune."</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, I'm sure, gents, but mean no offence:
am monstrous obliged to you for what you've done for me&mdash;but,
by Jove, it's taken me rather a-back, I own, to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
that I'm to be kept so long out of it all! Why can't
you offer him, whoever he is that has my property, a
slapping sum to go out at once? Gents, I'll own to you
I'm most uncommon low&mdash;never so low in my life&mdash;devilish
low! Done up, and yet it seems a'n't to get
what's justly mine! What am I to do in the meanwhile?
Consider <i>that</i>, gents!"</p>

<p>"You are rather excited just now, Mr. Titmouse," said
Mr. Quirk, seriously; "suppose we now break up, and resume
our conversation to-morrow, when we are all in
better and calmer trim?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, thanking you all the same; but I think we'd
better go on with it now," replied Titmouse, impetuously.
"Do you think I can stoop to go back to that nasty,
beastly shop, and stand behind that odious counter?&mdash;I'd
almost as lieve go to the gallows!"</p>

<p>"Our <i>decided</i> opinion, Mr. Titmouse," said Mr. Quirk,
emphatically&mdash;his other partners getting graver and
graver in their looks&mdash;"that is, if our opinion is worth offering"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"That, by Jove! remains to be seen," said Titmouse,
with a pettish shake of the head.</p>

<p>"Well, such as it is, we offer it you; and it is, that for
many reasons you must continue, for a little while longer,
in your present situation"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What! own Tag-rag for my master&mdash;and I worth
£10,000 a-year?" interrupted Titmouse, furiously.</p>

<p>"My dear sir, you've not <i>got</i> it yet," said Mr. Quirk,
with a very bitter smile.</p>

<p>"Do you think you'd have told me what you have, if
you weren't sure that I <i>should</i>, though? No, no! you've
gone too far, by Jove!&mdash;but I shall burst, I shall! Me
to go on as before!&mdash;they use me worse and worse every
day. Gents, you'll excuse me&mdash;I hope you will; but
business is business, gents&mdash;it is; and if you won't do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
mine, I must look out for them that will&mdash;'pon my soul,
I must, and"&mdash;If Mr. Titmouse could have seen, or having
seen, appreciated, the looks which the three partners
interchanged, on hearing this absurd, ungrateful, and insolent
speech of his&mdash;the expression that flitted across
their shrewd faces; that was, of intense contempt for him,
hardly overmastered and concealed by a vivid perception
of their own interest, which was, of course, to <i>manage</i>, to
soothe, to conciliate him!</p>

<p>How the reptile propensities of his mean nature had
thriven beneath the sudden sunshine of unexpected prosperity!&mdash;See
already his selfishness, truculence, rapacity,
in full play!</p>

<p>"So, gents," said he, after a long and keen expostulation
with them on the same subject, "I'm really to go
to-morrow morning to Tag-rag and Co.'s, and go on with
the cursed life I led there to-day, all as if nothing had
happened&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;I do so like that!"</p>

<p>"In your present humor, Mr. Titmouse, it would be
in vain to discuss the matter," said Mr. Quirk, sternly.
"Again I tell you that the course we have recommended
is, in our opinion, the proper one; excuse me if I add,
that you are entirely in our hands&mdash;and if I ask you&mdash;what
<i>can</i> you do but adopt our advice?"</p>

<p>"Why, hang me if I won't employ somebody else&mdash;that's
flat! S'&nbsp;elp me, Heaven, I will! So, good-night,
gents; you'll find that Tittlebat Titmouse isn't to be
trifled with!" So saying, Mr. Titmouse clapped his hat
on his head, bounced out of the room, and, no attempt
being made to stop him, he was in the street in a
twinkling.</p>

<p>Mr. Gammon gazed at Mr. Quirk with a look, the significance
of which the astounded old gentleman thoroughly
understood&mdash;'twas compounded of triumph, reproach, and apprehension.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you ever see such a little beast!" exclaimed Mr.
Quirk, with an air of disgust, turning to Mr. Snap.</p>

<p>"Beggar on horseback!" exclaimed Snap, with a bitter sneer.</p>

<p>"It won't do, however," said Mr. Quirk, with a most
chagrined and apprehensive air, "for him to go at large
in his present frame of mind&mdash;he may ruin the thing altogether"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"As good as £500 a-year out of the way of the office,"
quoth Snap.</p>

<p>"It cannot be helped <i>now</i>," said Mr. Gammon, with a
sigh of vexation, turning to Mr. Quirk, and seizing his hat&mdash;"he
must be managed&mdash;so I'll go after him instantly,
and bring him back at all hazards; and we must really
try and do something for him in the meanwhile, to keep
him quiet till the thing's brought a little into train." So
out went after Titmouse, Mr. Gammon, from whose lips
dropped persuasion sweeter than honey;[<a href='#Note_3'>3</a>] and I should
not be surprised if he were to succeed in bringing back
that little stubborn piece of conceited stupidity.</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Titmouse heard the street door shut after
him with a kind of <i>bang</i>, he snapped his fingers once or
twice, by way of letting off a little of the inflammable air
that was in him, and muttered, "Pretty chaps those, upon
my soul!" said he, disdainfully. "I'll expose them all!
I'll apply to the lord-mayor&mdash;they're a pack of swindlers,
they are! This is the way they treat <i>me</i>, who've
got a title to £10,000 a-year! To be sure"&mdash;He stood
still for a moment&mdash;and another moment&mdash;and another&mdash;and
then dismay came quickly over him; for the
thought suddenly occurred to his partially obfuscated
intellect&mdash;what <i>hold</i> had he got on Messrs. Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap?&mdash;what <i>could</i> he do?&mdash;or rather, what
<span class="smcap">had</span> he done?</p>

<p>Ah&mdash;the golden vision of the last few hours was fading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
away momentarily, like a dream! Each second of his
deep and rapid reflection, rendered more impetuous his
desire and determination to return and make his peace
with Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap. By submission
for the present, he could get the whip-hand of them hereafter!
He was in the act of turning round towards the
office, when Mr. Gammon gently laid his hand upon the
shoulder of his repentant client.</p>

<p>"Mr. Titmouse! my dear sir," said Mr. Gammon, softly,
"what is the matter with you? How could we so misunderstand
each other?"</p>

<p>Titmouse's small cunning was on the <i>qui vive</i>, and he
saw and followed up his advantage. "I am going," said
he, in a resolute tone, "to speak to some one else in the morning."</p>

<p>"Ah, to be sure!" replied Mr. Gammon, with a smile
of utter unconcern&mdash;"I supposed as much&mdash;'tis a matter
which of course, however, signifies nothing to any one&mdash;but
yourself. You will take any steps, my dear sir, that
occur to you, and act as you may be advised!"</p>

<p>"Monstrous kind of you, 'pon my life! to come and
give me such good advice!" exclaimed Titmouse, with a
sneer&mdash;but consciously baffled.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't mention it!" said Gammon, coolly; "I came
out of pure good-nature, to assure you that our office, notwithstanding
what has passed, entertains not the slightest
personal ill feeling towards you, in thus throwing off our
hands a fearfully expensive, and most harassing enterprise&mdash;which
we have feared from the first had been too rashly undertaken"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hem!" exclaimed Titmouse, involuntarily, once or twice.</p>

<p>"So good-night, Mr. Titmouse&mdash;good-night! God bless
you! and think hereafter of all this as a mere idle dream&mdash;as
far as <i>we</i> are concerned!" Mr. Gammon, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
act of returning to the door, extended his hand to Mr.
Titmouse, whom he instantly perceived to be melting rapidly.</p>

<p>"Why, sir," quoth Titmouse, with a mixture of embarrassment
and alarm, "if I thought you all meant
the correct thing&mdash;hem! I say, the <i>correct</i> thing by
me&mdash;I shouldn't so much mind a little disappointment
for the time; but you must own, Mr. Gammon, it is
very hard being kept out of one's own so long&mdash;honor,
now! isn't it?"</p>

<p>"True, very true, Mr. Titmouse. Very hard it is, indeed,
to bear, and we all felt deeply for you, and would
have set everything in train"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Would have!</i> oh my stars!"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear Mr. Titmouse, we <i>would</i> have done it,
and believed we could have brought you through every
difficulty&mdash;over every obstacle, prodigious though they
are, and almost innumerable."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;you&mdash;don't&mdash;hardly&mdash;quite&mdash;mean to say
you've given it all up?&mdash;What, already! 'Pon my life!
Oh Lord!" exclaimed Titmouse, in evident trepidation.</p>

<p>Mr. Gammon had triumphed over Mr. Titmouse!
whom, nothing loath, he brought back, in two minutes'
time, into the room which Titmouse had just before so
insolently quitted. Mr. Quirk and Mr. Snap had now
<i>their</i> parts to perform in the little scene which they
had determined on enacting. They were in the act
of locking up desks and drawers, evidently on the
move, and received Mr. Titmouse with an air of cold surprise.</p>

<p>"Mr. Titmouse again!" exclaimed Mr. Quirk, taking
his gloves out of his hat. "Back again!&mdash;This, sir, is
quite an unexpected honor!"</p>

<p>"Leave anything behind?" inquired Mr. Snap, affecting
to look about him&mdash;"don't <i>see</i> anything"&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir! No, sir!" exclaimed Titmouse, with
eager anxiety. "This gent, Mr. Gammon, and I, have
made it all up, gents! I'm not angry any more&mdash;not
the least, 'pon my soul I'm not&mdash;and quite forgive you&mdash;and
no mistake!"</p>

<p>"<i>Angry!</i>&mdash;<i>Forgive!!</i> Mr. Titmouse!" echoed Mr.
Quirk, with an air sternly ironical. "We are under
great obligations to you for your forbearance!"</p>

<p>"Oh, come, gents!" said Titmouse, more and more
disturbed, "I <i>was</i> too warm, I dare say, and&mdash;and&mdash;I
ask your pardon, all of you, gents! I won't say another
word if you'll but buckle to business again&mdash;quite exactly
in your own way&mdash;because you see"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's growing <i>very</i> late," said Mr. Quirk, coldly, and
looking at his watch; "however, after what you have
said, probably at some future time, when we've <i>leisure</i>
to look into the thing"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Poor Titmouse was near dropping on his knees, in
mingled agony and fright.</p>

<p>"May I be allowed to say," interposed the bland voice
of Mr. Gammon, anxiously addressing himself to Mr.
Quirk, "that Mr. Titmouse a few minutes ago assured
me, outside there, that if you, as the head of the firm,
could only be persuaded to permit our house to take up
his case again"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I did&mdash;I did indeed, gents! so help me&mdash;&mdash;!" interrupted
Mr. Titmouse, eagerly backing with an oath
the ready lie of Mr. Gammon.</p>

<p>Mr. Quirk, with a stern countenance, drew his hand
across his chin musingly, and stood silently for a few
moments, apparently irresolute.</p>

<p>"Well," said he at length, but very coldly, "since that
is so, probably we may be induced to resume our heavy
labors in your behalf; and if you will favor us with a call
to-morrow night, at the same hour, we may have, by that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
time, made up our minds as to the course we shall think
fit to adopt."</p>

<p>"Lord, sir, I'll be here as the clock strikes, and as
meek as a mouse; and pray, have it all your own way
for the future, gents&mdash;do!"&mdash;cried Titmouse, clasping
his hands together on his breast.</p>

<p>"Good-night, sir&mdash;good-night!" exclaimed the partners,
stiffly&mdash;motioning him towards the door.</p>

<p>"Good-night, gents!" said Titmouse, bowing very low,
and feeling himself at the same time being&mdash;bowed <i>out</i>!
As he passed out of the room, he cast a lingering look
at their three frigid faces, as if they were angels sternly
shutting him out from Paradise. What misery was his,
as he walked slowly homeward, with much the same feelings
(now that the fumes of the brandy had somewhat
evaporated, and the reaction of excitement was coming
on, aggravated by a recollection of the desperate check
he had received) as those of a sick and troubled man,
who, suddenly roused out of a delicious dream, drops into
wretched reality, as it were out of a fairyland, which,
with all its dear innumerable delights, is melting overhead
into thin air&mdash;disappearing, <i>forever</i>!</p>

<p>Closet Court had never looked so odious to him as it
did on his return from this memorable interview. Dreadfully
distressed and harassed, he flung himself on his bed
for a moment, directly he had shut his door, intending
presently to rise and undress; but Sleep, having got
him prostrate, secured her victory. She waved her black
wand over him, and&mdash;he awoke not completely till about
eight o'clock in the morning. A second long-drawn sigh
was preparing to follow its predecessor, when he heard
the clock strike eight, and sprang off the bed in a fright;
for he ought to have been at the shop an hour before.
Dashing a little water into his face, and scarce staying
to wipe it off, he ran down-stairs, through the court, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
along the street, never stopping till he had found his way
into&mdash;almost the very arms of the dreaded Mr. Tag-rag;
who, rarely making his appearance till about half-past
nine, had, as the deuce would have it, happened to come
down an hour and a half earlier than usual on that particular
morning, the only one out of several hundreds on
which Titmouse had been more than ten minutes beyond
his time.</p>

<p>"Yours ve-ry respectfully, Mr. Titmouse&mdash;Thomas
Tag-rag!" exclaimed that personage, with mock solemnity,
bowing formally to his astounded and breathless shopman.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;beg your pardon, sir; but I wasn't very
well, and overslept myself," stammered Titmouse.</p>

<p>"Ne-ver mind, Mr. Titmouse! ne-ver mind!&mdash;it don't
much signify, as it happens," interrupted Mr. Tag-rag, bitterly;
"you've just got an hour and a half to take this
piece of silk, with my compliments, to Messrs. Shuttle and
Weaver, in Dirt Street, Spitalfields, and ask them if they
aren't ashamed to send it to a West-end house like mine;
and bring back a better piece instead of it! D'&nbsp;ye <i>hear</i>, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;but&mdash;am I to go before my breakfast, sir?"</p>

<p>"Did I say a word about breakfast, sir? You heard
my orders, sir; you can attend to them or not, Mr. Titmouse,
as you please!"</p>

<p>Off trotted Titmouse <i>instanter</i>, without his breakfast;
and so Tag-rag gained one object he had had in view.
Titmouse found this rather trying: a four-mile walk before
him, with no inconsiderable load under his arm;
having, moreover, had nothing to eat since the preceding
evening, when he had partaken of a delicate repast of
thick slices of bread, smeared slightly over with somewhat
high-flavored salt butter, and moistened with a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
astringent decoction of <i>quasi</i> tea-leaves sweetened with
brown sugar, and discolored with sky-blue milk. He had
not even a farthing about him wherewith to buy a penny
roll! As he went disconsolately along, so many doubts
and fears buzzed impetuously about him, that they completely
darkened his little soul, and bewildered his petty
understanding. <i>Ten Thousand a-Year!</i>&mdash;it could never
be meant for the like of <i>him</i>! He soon worked himself
into a conviction that the whole thing was infinitely too
good to be true; the affair was desperate; it had been
all moonshine; for some cunning purpose or another,
Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, had been&mdash;ah, here
he was within a few yards of their residence, the scene of
last night's tragic transactions! As he passed Saffron
Hill, he paused, looked up towards the blessed abode,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where centred all his hopes and fears,"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>uttered a profound sigh, and passed slowly on towards
Smithfield. The words "<i>Quirk, Gammon, and Snap</i>,"
seemed to be written over every shop-window which he
passed&mdash;their images filled his mind's eye. What could
they be at? They had been all very polite and friendly
at first&mdash;and of their own seeking: but he had affronted
them. How coldly and proudly they had parted with
him over-night, although they had professed themselves
reconciled to him! It was evident that they would stand
no nonsense&mdash;they were great lawyers; so he must (if
they really would allow him to see them again) eat humble
pie cheerfully till he had got all that they had to give
him. How he dreaded the coming night! Perhaps they
intended civilly to tell him that, since seeing him, they
would have nothing more to do with him; they would
get the estate for themselves, or some one else who would
be more manageable! They had taken care to tell him
nothing at all about the nature of his pretensions to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
grand fortune. Oh, how crafty they were&mdash;they had it
all their own way!&mdash;But what, after all, had he really
done? The estates were his, if they were really in earnest&mdash;his
and no one's else; and why should he be kept
out of them at their will and pleasure? Suppose he
were to say he would give them all he was entitled to
for £20,000 down, in cash? Oh no; on second thoughts,
that would be only two years' income! But on the other
hand&mdash;he dared hardly even propose it to his thoughts&mdash;still,
suppose it <i>should</i> really all turn out true! Goodness
gracious!&mdash;that day two months he might be riding
about in his carriage in the Parks, and poor devils looking
on at <i>him</i>, as he now looked on all those who now
rode there. There he would be, holding up his head
with the best of them, instead of slaving as he was that
moment, carrying about that cursed bundle&mdash;ough! how
he shrunk with disgust as he changed its position, to relieve
his aching right arm! Why was his mouth to be
stopped&mdash;why might he not tell his shopmates? What
would he not give for the luxury of telling it to the odious
Tag-rag? If he <i>were</i> to do so, Mr. Tag-rag, he was sure,
would ask him to dinner the very next Sunday, at his
country house at Clapham!&mdash;Ah, ha!&mdash;Thoughts such
as these so occupied his mind, that he did not for a long
while observe that he was walking at a rapid rate towards
the Mile-end road, having left Whitechapel church nearly
half a mile behind him! The possible master of £10,000
a-year was nearly dropping with fatigue, and sudden apprehension
of the storm he should have to encounter
when he first saw Mr. Tag-rag after so unduly prolonged
an absence on his errand. He was detained for a cruel
length of time at Messrs. Shuttle and Weaver's; who,
not having the exact kind of silk required by their imperious
customer at that moment on their premises, had
some difficulty in obtaining it, after having sent for it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
one or two neighboring manufactories; by which means it
came to pass that it was two o'clock before Titmouse, completely
exhausted, had returned to Tag-rag and Company's.
The gentlemen of the shop had finished their dinners.</p>

<p>"Go up-stairs and get your dinner, sir!" exclaimed
Tag-rag, sternly, after having received Messrs. Shuttle and
Weaver's obsequious message of apologies and hopes.</p>

<p>Titmouse having laid down his heavy bundle on the
counter, went up-stairs hungry enough, and found himself
the sole occupant of the long close-smelling room in which
his companions had been recently dining. His dinner
was presently brought to him by a slatternly slipshod
servant-girl. It was in an uncovered basin, which appeared
to contain nothing but the leavings of his companions&mdash;a
savory intermixture of cold potatoes, broken
meat, (chiefly bits of fat and gristle,) a little hot water
having been thrown over it to make it appear warm and
fresh&mdash;(faugh!) His plate (with a small pinch of salt
upon it) had not been cleaned after its recent use, but evidently
only hastily smeared over with a greasy towel, as
also seemed his knife and fork, which, in their disgusting
state, he was fain to put up with&mdash;the table-cloth on
which he might have wiped them, having been removed.
A hunch of bread that seemed to have been tossing about
in the pan for days, and half a pint of turbid table-beer,
completed the fare set before him; opposite which he sat
for some minutes, too much occupied with his reflections
to commence his repast. He was in the act of scooping
out of the basin some of its inviting contents, when&mdash;"Titmouse!"
exclaimed the voice of one of his shopmates,
peering in at him through the half-opened door,
"Mr. Tag-rag wants you! He says you've had plenty of
time to finish your dinner!"</p>

<p>"Oh, tell him, then, I'm only just beginning my dinner&mdash;eugh!
such as it is," replied Titmouse, sulkily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>In a few minutes' time Mr. Tag-rag himself entered the
room, stuttering with fury&mdash;"How much longer, sir, may
it be your pleasure to spend over your dinner, eh?"</p>

<p>"Not another moment, sir," answered Titmouse, looking
with unaffected loathing and disgust at the savory
victuals before him; "if you'll only allow me a few
minutes to go home and buy a penny roll instead of all this"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ve&mdash;ry good, sir! Ve&mdash;ry parti&mdash;cu&mdash;larly good,
Mr. Titmouse," replied Tag-rag, with ill-subdued rage;
"anything else that I can make a <i>leetle</i> memorandum of&mdash;against
the day of&mdash;your leaving us?"</p>

<p>This hint of twofold terror, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of withholding on the
ground of misconduct the wretched balance of salary
which might be then due to him, and of also giving him
a damning character&mdash;dispelled the small remains of Titmouse's
appetite, and he rose to return to the shop, involuntarily
clutching his fist as he brushed close past the
tyrant Tag-rag on the stairs, whom he would have been delighted
to pitch down head-foremost. If he <i>had</i> done so,
none of his fellow-slaves below, in spite of their present
sycophancy towards Tag-rag, would have shown any particular
alacrity in picking up their common oppressor. Poor
Tittlebat resumed his old situation behind the counter;
but how different his present, from his former air and
manner! With his pen occasionally peeping pertly out
of his bushy hair over his right ear, and his yard-measure
in his hand, no one, till the previous Monday morning,
had been more cheerful, smirking, and nimble than Tittlebat
Titmouse: alas, how chopfallen now! None of
his companions could make him out, or guess what was
in the wind; so they very justly concluded that he had
been doing something dreadfully disgraceful, the extent of
which was known to Tag-rag and himself alone. Their
jeers and banter were giving place to cold distrustful looks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
which were far more trying to bear. How he longed to
be able to burst upon their astounded minds with the pent-up
intelligence that was silently racking and splitting his
little bosom! But if he did&mdash;the terrible firm of Quirk,
Gammon, and Snap&mdash;Oh! the very thought of them glued
his lips together. There was <i>one</i>, however, of whom he
might surely make a confidant&mdash;the excellent Huckaback,
with whom he had had no opportunity of communicating
since Sunday night. That gentleman was as close a prisoner
at the establishment of <span class="smcap">Diaper</span> and <span class="smcap">Sarsenet</span>, in Tottenham-court
Road, as Titmouse at Messrs. Tag-rag's, of
which said establishment he was, by the way, quite as great
an ornament as Titmouse of Messrs. Tag-rag's. They were
of about the same height, and equals in vulgar puppyism
of manners, dress, and appearance; but Titmouse was
certainly the better-looking. With equal conceit apparent
in their faces, that of Huckaback, square, flat, and
sallow, had an expression of ineffable impudence, made a
lady shudder, and a gentleman feel a tingling sensation in
his right toe. About his small black eyes there was a glimmer
of low cunning;&mdash;but he is not of sufficient importance
to be painted any further. When Titmouse left
the shop that night, a little after nine, he hurried to his
lodgings, to make himself as imposing in his appearance
before Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, as his time
and means would admit of. Behold, on a table lay a letter
from Huckaback. It was written in a flourishing
mercantile hand; and here is a <i>verbatim</i> copy of it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Tit</span>,</p>

<p>"Hope you are well, which is what I can only middling say
in respect of me. Such a row with my governors as I have had
to-day! I thought that as I had been in the House near upon
Eighteen Months at £25 per annum, I might nat'rally ask for
£30 a-year (which is what my Predecessor had) when, would
you believe it, Mr. Sharpeye (who is going to be taken in as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Partner,) to whom I named the thing, ris up in rage against
me, and I were had up into the counting-house, where both the
governors was, and they gave it me in such a way that you
never saw nor heard of; but it wasn't all on their own side, as
you know me too well to think of. You would have thought
I had been a-going to rob the house. They said I was most
oudacious, and all that, and ungrateful, and what would I have
next? Mr. Diaper said times was come to such a pitch!! since
when he was first in the business, for salaries, says he, is ris to
double, and not half the work done that was, and no gratitude&mdash;(cursed
old curmudgeon!) He said if I left them just now,
I might whistle for a character, except one that I should not
like; but if he don't mind I'll give him a touch of law about
that&mdash;which brings me to what happened to-day with <i>our</i> lawyers,
Titty, the people at Saffron Hill, whom I thought I would
call in on to-day, being near the neighborhood with some light
goods, to see how affairs was getting on, and stir them up a bit"&mdash;</p></div>

<p>This almost took Titmouse's breath away&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&mdash;"feeling most <i>interested</i> on your account, as you know, dear
Tit, I do. I said I wanted to speak to one of the gentlemen on
business of wital importance; whereat I was quickly shown into
a room where two gents was sitting. Having put down my
parcel for a minute on the table, I said I was a very partic'lar
friend of yours, and had called in to see how things went on
about the advertisement; whereat you never saw in your life
how struck they looked, and stared at one another in speechless
silence, till they said to me, what concerned me about the business?
or something of that nature, but in such a way that <i>ris</i>
a <i>rage</i> in me directly, all for your sake, (for I did not like the
looks of things;) and says I, I said, we would let them know
we were not to be <i>gammoned</i>; whereat up rose the youngest of
the two, and ringing the bell, he says to a tight-laced young gentleman
with a pen behind his ear, 'Show this fellow to the door,'
which I was at once; but, in doing so, let out a little of my
mind to them. They're no better than they should be, you see
if they are; but when we touch the property, we'll show them
who is their masters, which consoles me. Good-by, keep your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
sperrits up, and I will call and tell you more about it on Sunday.
So farewell (I write this at Mr. Sharpeye's desk, who is
coming down from dinner directly, the beast!)&mdash;Your true friend,</p>

<p class='sigr' style='margin-left:2em;'>"<span class="smcap">R. Huckaback</span>.</p>

<p>"P. S.&mdash;Met a young Jew last night with a lot of prime
cigars, and (knowing he <i>must</i> have stole them&mdash;betwixt you,
and I, and the Post&mdash;they looked so good at the price,) I
bought one shilling's worth for me, and two shillings' worth
for you, your salary being higher, and to say nothing of your chances."</p></div>

<p>All that part of the foregoing letter which related to its
gifted writer's interview with Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and
Snap, Titmouse read in a kind of spasm&mdash;he could not
draw a breath, and felt a choking sensation coming over
him. After a while, "I may spare myself," thought he,
"the trouble of rigging out&mdash;Huckaback has done my
business for me with Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap!&mdash;Mine
will only be a walk in vain!" And this cursed
call of Huckaback's, too, to have happened after what had
occurred last night between Titmouse and them!! and so
urgently as he had been enjoined to keep the matter to
himself! Of course, Huckaback would seem to have been
sent by him; seeing he appeared to have assumed the
hectoring tone which Titmouse had tried so vainly over-night,
and now so bitterly repented of; and he had no
doubt grossly insulted the arbiters of Titmouse's destiny,
(for he knew Huckaback's impudence)&mdash;he had even said
that he (Titmouse) would not be <span class="smcap">gammoned</span> by them! But
time was pressing&mdash;the experiment must be made; and
with a beating heart he scrambled into a change of clothes&mdash;bottling
up his wrath against the unconscious Huckaback
till he should see that worthy. In a miserable state
of mind he set off soon after for Saffron Hill at a quick
pace, which soon became a trot, and often sharpened into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
a downright run. He saw, heard, and thought of nothing,
as he hurried along Oxford Street and Holborn, but Quirk,
Gammon, Snap, and Huckaback, and the reception which
the last-mentioned gentleman might have secured for him&mdash;if,
indeed, he was to be received at all. The magical
words, <i>Ten Thousand a-year</i>, had not disappeared from the
field of his troubled vision; but how faintly and dimly they
shone!&mdash;like the Pleiades coldly glistening through intervening
mists far off&mdash;oh! at what a stupendous, immeasurable,
and hopeless distance! Imagine those stars gazed
at by the anguished and despairing eyes of the bereaved
lover, madly believing one of them to contain <span class="smcap">her</span> who
has just departed from his arms, and from this world, and
you may form a notion of the agonizing feelings&mdash;the
absorbed contemplation of one dear, dazzling, but distant
object, experienced on this occasion by Mr. Titmouse. No,
no; I don't mean seriously to pretend that so grand a
thought as this <i>could</i> be entertained by his little optics
intellectual; you might as well suppose the tiny eye of a
black beetle to be scanning the vague, fanciful, and mysterious
figure and proportions of Orion, or a kangaroo to
be perusing and pondering over the immortal <i>Principia</i>.
I repeat, that I have no desire of the sort, and am determined
not again foolishly to attempt fine writing, which I
now perceive to be entirely out of my line. In language
more befitting me and my subject, I may be allowed to
say that there is no getting the contents of a quart into
a pint pot; that Titmouse's mind was a half-pint&mdash;and
it was brim-full. All the while that I have been going on
thus, however, Titmouse was hurrying down Holborn at
a rattling rate. When at length he had reached Saffron
Hill, he was in a bath of perspiration. His face was quite
red; he breathed hard; his heart beat violently; he had
got a stitch in his side; and he could not get his gloves on
his hot and swollen hands. He stood for a moment with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
his hat off, wiping his reeking forehead, and endeavoring
to recover himself a little, before entering the dreaded
presence to which he had been hastening. He even fancied
for a moment that his eyes gave out sparks of light.
While thus pausing, St. Andrew's Church struck ten, half
electrifying Titmouse, who bolted up Saffron Hill, and
was soon standing opposite the door. How the sight of
it smote him, as it reminded him of the way in which, on
the preceding night, he had bounced out of it! But that
could not now be helped; so <i>ring</i> went the bell; as softly,
however, as he could; for he recollected that it was a very
loud bell, and he did not wish to offend. He stood for
some time, and nobody answered. He waited for nearly
two minutes, and trembled, assailed by a thousand vague
fears. He might not, however, have rung loudly enough&mdash;so&mdash;again,
a little louder, did he venture to ring.
Again he waited. There seemed something threatening
in the great brass plate on the door, out of which "<span class="smcap">Quirk,
Gammon, and Snap</span>" appeared to look at him ominously.
While he thought of it, by the way, there was something
very serious and stern in all their faces&mdash;he wondered
that he had not noticed it before. What a drunken beast
he had been to go on in their presence as he had! thought
he; then Huckaback's image flitted across his disturbed
fancy. "Ah!" thought he, "that's the thing!&mdash;that's
it, depend upon it: this door will never be opened to <i>me</i>
again&mdash;he's done for me!" He breathed faster, clinched
his fist, and involuntarily raised it in a menacing way, when
he heard himself addressed&mdash;"Oh! dear me, sir, I <i>hope</i> I
haven't kept you waiting," said the old woman whom he
had before seen, fumbling in her pocket for the door-key.
She had been evidently out shopping, having a plate in
her left hand, over which her apron was partially thrown.
"Hope you've not been ringing long, sir!"</p>

<p>"Oh dear! no ma'am," replied Titmouse, with anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
civility, and a truly miserable smile&mdash;"Afraid I may
have kept <i>them</i> waiting," he added, almost dreading to
hear the answer.</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir, not at all&mdash;they've all been gone since a
little after nine; but there's a letter I was to give you!"
She opened the door; Titmouse nearly dropping with
fright. "I'll get it for you, sir&mdash;let me see, where did
I put it?&mdash;Oh, in the clerk's room, I think." Titmouse
followed her in. "Dear me&mdash;where can it be?" she continued,
peering about, and then snuffing the long wick of
the candle, which she had left burning for the last quarter
of an hour, during her absence. "I <i>hope</i> none of the
clerks has put it away in mistake! Well, it isn't <i>here</i>, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, ma'am, it's in their <i>own</i> room," suggested
Titmouse, in a faint tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, p'r'aps it is!" she replied. "We'll go and see"&mdash;and
she led the way, followed closely by Titmouse, who
caught his breath spasmodically as he passed the green-baize
door. Yes, there was the room&mdash;the scene of last
night was transacted there, and came crowding over his
recollection&mdash;there was the green-shaded candlestick&mdash;the
table covered with papers&mdash;an arm-chair near it, in
which, probably, Mr. Quirk had been sitting only an hour
before to write the letter they were now in quest of, and
which might be to forbid him their presence forever!
How dreary and deserted the room looked, thought he as
he peered about it in search of the dreaded letter!</p>

<p>"Oh, here it is!&mdash;well, I never!&mdash;who could have
put it here, now? I'm sure I didn't. Let me see&mdash;it
was, no doubt"&mdash;said the old woman, holding the letter
in one hand and putting the other to her head.</p>

<p>"Never mind, ma'am," said Titmouse, stretching his
hand towards her&mdash;"now we've got it, it don't much
signify." She gave it to him. "Seem <i>particularly</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
anxious for me to get it&mdash;did they, ma'am?" he inquired,
with a strong effort to appear unconcerned&mdash;the dreaded
letter quite quivering, the while, in his fingers.</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;Mr. Quirk only said I was to give it you
when you called. B'lieve they sent it to you, but the
clerk said he couldn't find your place out; by the way,
(excuse me, sir,) but yours <i>is</i> a funny name! How I
heard 'em laughing at it, to be sure! What makes people
give such queer names? Would you like to read it
here, sir?&mdash;you're welcome."</p>

<p>"No, thank you, ma'am&mdash;it's of not the <i>least</i> consequence,"
he replied, with a desperate air; and tossing it
with attempted carelessness into his hat, which he put
on his head, he very civilly wished her good-night, and
departed&mdash;very nearly inclined to sickness, or faintness,
or something of the sort, which the fresh air might
perhaps dispel. He quickly espied a lamp at a corner,
which promised to afford him an uninterrupted opportunity
of inspecting his letter. He took it out of his
hat. It was addressed&mdash;simply, "Mr. Titmouse, <i>Cocking</i>
Court, Oxford Street," (which accounted, perhaps, for the
clerk's having been unable to find it;) and having been
opened with trembling eagerness, thus it read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, present their compliments
to Mr. Titmouse, and are anxious to save him
the trouble of his intended visit this evening.</p>

<p>"They exceedingly regret that obstacles (which it is to be
hoped, however, may not prove <i>ultimately</i> insurmountable)
exist in the way of their prosecuting their intended inquiries
on behalf of Mr. Titmouse.</p>

<p>"Since their last night's interview with him, circumstances,
which they could not have foreseen, and over which they have
no control, have occurred, which render it unnecessary for Mr.
T. to give himself any more anxiety in the affair&mdash;at least,
not until he shall have heard from Messrs. Q. G. and S.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"If anything of importance <i>should</i> hereafter transpire, it is
not improbable that Mr. T. may hear from them.</p>

<p>"They were favored, this afternoon, with a visit from Mr.
T.'s friend&mdash;a Mr. Hucklebottom."</p>

<p>"<i>Saffron Hill, Wednesday Evening, 12th July 18&mdash;.</i>"</p></div>

<p>When poor Titmouse had finished reading over this
vague, frigid, and disheartening note a second time, a
convulsive sob or two pierced his bosom, indicative of its
being indeed swollen with sorrow; and at length, overcome
by his feelings, he cried bitterly&mdash;not checked even
by the occasional exclamations of one or two passers-by.
He could not at all control himself. He felt as if he
could have almost relieved himself, by banging his head
against the wall! A tumultuous feeling of mingled grief
and despair prevented his thoughts, for a long while, from
settling on any one idea or object. At length, when the
violence of the storm had somewhat abated, on concluding
a third perusal of the death-warrant to all his hopes,
which he held in his hand, his eye lit upon the strange
word which was intended to designate his friend Huckaback;
and it instantly changed both the kind of his feelings,
and the current in which they had been rushing.
Grief became rage; and the stream foamed in quite a
new direction&mdash;namely, towards Huckaback. That accursed
fellow he considered to be the sole cause of the
direful disaster which had befallen him. He utterly lost
sight of one circumstance, which one might have imagined
likely to have occurred to his thoughts at such a time&mdash;viz.
his own offensive and insolent behavior over-night to
Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap. Yet so it was:&mdash;yes,
upon the devoted (but unconscious) head of Huckaback,
was the lightning rage of Tittlebat Titmouse doomed to
descend. The fire that was thus quickly kindled within,
soon dried up the source of his tears. He crammed
the letter into his pocket, and started off at once in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
direction of Leicester Square, breathing rage at every
step&mdash;<i>viresque acquirens eundo</i>. His hands kept convulsively
clinching together as he pelted along. Hotter
and hotter became his rage as he neared the residence
of Huckaback. When he had reached it, he sprang up-stairs;
knocked at his <i>quondam</i> friend's door; and on the
instant of its being&mdash;doubtless somewhat surprisedly&mdash;opened
by Huckaback, who was undressing, Titmouse
sprang towards him, let fly a goodly number of violent
blows upon his face and breast&mdash;and down fell Huckaback
upon the bed behind him, insensible, and bleeding
profusely from his nose.</p>

<p>"There! there!"&mdash;gasped Titmouse, breathless and
exhausted, discharging a volley of oaths and opprobrious
epithets at the victim of his fury. "Do it again! You
will, won't you? <i>You'll</i> go&mdash;and meddle again in other
people's&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash; cu-cu-cursed officious"&mdash;but his rage
was spent&mdash;the paroxysm was over; the silent and
bleeding figure of Huckaback was before his eyes; and
he gazed at him, terror-stricken. What had he done!
He sank down on the bed beside Huckaback&mdash;then
started up, wringing his hands, and staring at him in an
ecstasy of remorse and fright. It was rather singular
that the noise of such an assault should have roused no
one to inquire into it; but so it was. Frightened almost
out of his bewildered senses, he closed and bolted the
door; and addressed himself, as well as he was able, to
the recovering of Huckaback. After propping him up,
and splashing cold water into his face, Titmouse at length
discovered symptoms of restoration to consciousness, which
he anxiously endeavored to accelerate, by putting to the
lips of the slowly-reviving victim of his violence some
cold water, in a tea-cup. He swallowed a little; and soon
afterwards, opening his eyes, stared on Titmouse with a
dull eye and bewildered air.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's been the matter?" at length he faintly inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, Hucky! so glad to hear you speak again. It's
I&mdash;I&mdash;Titty! I did it! Strike me, Hucky, as soon
as you're well enough! Do&mdash;kick me&mdash;anything you
choose! I won't hinder you!" cried Titmouse, sinking
on his knees, and clasping his hands together, as he
perceived Huckaback rapidly reviving.</p>

<p>"Why, what <i>is</i> the matter?" repeated that gentleman,
with a wondering air, raising his hand to his nose, from
which the blood was still trickling. The fact is, that he
had lost his senses, probably from the suddenness, rather
than the violence of the injuries which he had received.</p>

<p>"I did it all&mdash;yes, I did!" continued Titmouse, gazing
on him with a look of agony and remorse.</p>

<p>"Why, I can't be awake&mdash;I can't!" said Huckaback,
rubbing his eyes, and then staring at his wet and blood-stained
shirt-front and hands.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you are&mdash;you are!" groaned Titmouse;
"and I'm going <i>mad</i> as fast as I can! Do what you
like to me! Kick me if you please! Call in a constable!
Send me to jail! Say I came to rob you&mdash;anything&mdash;blow
me if I care what becomes of me!"</p>

<p>"Why, what <i>does</i> all this jabber mean, Titmouse?"
inquired Huckaback, sternly, and apparently meditating reprisals.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I see! Now you <i>are</i> going to give it me!
but I won't stir. So hit away, Hucky."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;are you mad?" inquired Huckaback, grasping
him by the collar rather roughly.</p>

<p>"Yes, quite! Mad!&mdash;ruined!&mdash;gone to the devil
all at once!"</p>

<p>"And what if you are? What did it matter to <i>me</i>?
What brought you here?" continued Huckaback, in a
tone of increasing vehemence. "What have I done to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
offend you? How <i>dare</i> you come <i>here</i>? And at this
time of night, too? Eh?"</p>

<p>"What, indeed! Oh lud, oh lud, oh lud! Kick me,
I say&mdash;strike me! You'll do me good, and bring me
to my senses. <i>Me</i> to do all this to you! And we've
been such precious good friends always. I'm a brute,
Hucky&mdash;I've been mad, stark mad, Hucky&mdash;and that's
all I can say!"</p>

<p>Huckaback stared at him more and more; and began
at length to suspect how matters stood&mdash;namely, that
the Sunday's incident had turned Titmouse's head&mdash;he
having also, no doubt, heard some desperate bad news
during the day, smashing all his hopes. A mixture of
emotions kept Huckaback silent.
Astonishment&mdash;apprehension&mdash;doubt&mdash;pride&mdash;pique&mdash;resentment.
He had been <i>struck</i>&mdash;his blood had been drawn&mdash;by the man
there before him on his knees, formerly his friend; now,
he supposed, a madman.</p>

<p>"Why, curse me, Titmouse, if I can make up my mind
what to do to you!" he exclaimed, "I&mdash;I suppose you
are going mad, or gone mad, and I must forgive you.
But get away with you&mdash;out with you, or&mdash;or&mdash;I'll
call in"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Forgive me&mdash;forgive me, dear Hucky! Don't send
me away&mdash;I shall go and drown myself if you do."</p>

<p>"What the d&mdash;l do I care if you do? You'd much
better have gone and done it before you came here.
Nay, be off and do it <i>now</i>, instead of blubbering here
in this way."</p>

<p>"Go on! go on!&mdash;it's doing me good&mdash;the worse
the better!" sobbed Titmouse.</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Huckaback, roughly, "none of this
noise here. I'm tired of it!"</p>

<p>"But, pray, don't send me away from you. I shall go
straight to the devil if you do! I've no friend but you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Hucky. Yet I've been such a villain to you!&mdash;But it
quite put the devil into me, when all of a sudden I found
it was <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"Me!&mdash;Why, what <i>are</i> you after?" interrupted Huckaback,
with an air of angry wonder.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, dear!" groaned Titmouse; "if I've been a
brute to you, which is quite true, <i>you've</i> been the <i>ruin</i>
of me, clean! I'm clean done for, Huck. Cleaned out!
You've done my business for me; knocked it all on
the head!&mdash;I sha'n't never hear any more of it&mdash;they've
said as much in their letter&mdash;they say you
called to-day"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Huckaback now began to have a glimmering notion of
his having been, in some considerable degree, connected
with the mischief of the day&mdash;an unconscious agent in
it. He audibly drew in his breath, as it were, as he
more and more distinctly recollected his visit to Messrs.
Quirk, Gammon, and Snap; and adverted more particularly
to his <i>threats</i>, uttered, too, in Titmouse's name,
and as if by his authority. Whew! here was a kettle
of fish.</p>

<p>Now, strange and unaccountable as, at first thought, it
may appear, the very circumstance which one should have
thought calculated to assuage his resentment against Titmouse&mdash;namely,
that he had really <i>injured</i> Titmouse most
seriously, (if not indeed irreparably,) and so <i>provoked</i> the
drubbing which had just been administered to him&mdash;had
quite the contrary effect. Paradoxical as it may seem,
matter of clear mitigation was at once converted into
matter of aggravation. Were the feelings which Huckaback
then experienced, akin to that which often produces
hatred of a person whom one has injured? May it be
thus accounted for? That there is a secret satisfaction
in the mere consciousness of being a sufferer&mdash;a martyr&mdash;and
that, too, in the presence of a person whom one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
perceives to be aware that he has wantonly injured one;
that one's bruised spirit is soothed by the sight of his remorse&mdash;by
the consciousness that he is punishing himself
infinitely more severely than <i>we</i> could punish him;
and of the claim one has obtained to the <i>sympathy</i> of
everybody who sees, or may hear of one's sufferings, (that
rich and grateful balm to injured feeling.) But when, as
in the case of Huckaback, feelings of this description (in
a coarse and small way, to be sure, according to his kind)
were suddenly encountered by a consciousness of his having
<i>deserved</i> his sufferings; when the martyr felt himself
quickly sinking into the culprit and offender; when, I
say, Huckaback felt an involuntary consciousness that the
gross indignities which Titmouse had just inflicted on
him, had been justified by the provocation&mdash;nay, had
been far less than his mischievous and impudent interference
had deserved;&mdash;and when feelings of this sort,
moreover, were sharpened by a certain tingling sense of
physical pain from the blows which he had received&mdash;the
result was, that the sleeping lion of Huckaback's
courage was very nearly awakening.</p>

<p>"<i>I've half a mind, Titmouse</i>"&mdash;said Huckaback, knitting
his brows, fixing his eyes, and appearing inclined to
raise his arm. There was an ominous pause for a moment
or two, during which Titmouse's feelings also underwent
a slight alteration. His allusion to Huckaback's ruinous
insult to Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, unconsciously
converted his remorse into rage, which it rather, perhaps,
resuscitated. Titmouse rose from his knees. "Ah!" said
he, in quite an altered tone, "you <i>may</i> look fierce! you
may!&mdash;you'd better strike me, Huckaback&mdash;do! Finish
the mischief you've begun this day! Hit away&mdash;you're
quite safe"&mdash;and he secretly prepared himself for the
mischief which&mdash;did not come. "You <i>have</i> ruined me!
you have, Huckaback!" he continued with increasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
vehemence; "and I shall be cutting my throat&mdash;nay,"
striking his fist on the table, "I will!"</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" exclaimed Huckaback, apprehensively.
"No, Titmouse, don't&mdash;don't think of it; it will
all come right yet, depend on't; you see if it don't!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, it's all done for&mdash;it's all up with me!"</p>

<p>"But <i>what's</i> been done?&mdash;let us hear," said Huckaback,
as he passed a wet towel to and fro over his ensanguined
features. It was by this time clear that the storm
which had for some time given out only a few faint fitful
flashes or flickerings in the distance, had passed away.
Titmouse, with many grievous sighs, took out the letter
which had produced the paroxysms I have been describing,
and read it aloud. "And only see how they've
spelled your name, Huckaback&mdash;look!" he added, handing
his friend the letter.</p>

<p>"How <i>partic'lar</i> vulgar!" exclaimed Huckaback, with
a contemptuous air, which, overspreading his features, half-closed
as was his left eye, and swollen as were his cheek
and nose, would have made him a queer object to one who
had leisure to observe such matters. "And so <i>this</i> is all
they say of <i>me</i>," he continued. "How do you come to
know that I've been doing you mischief? All I did was
just to look in, as respectful as possible, to ask how you
was, and they very civilly told me you was very well,
and we parted"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nay, now, that's a lie, Huckaback, and you know
it!" interrupted Titmouse.</p>

<p>"It's true, so help me&mdash;&mdash;!" vehemently asseverated Huckaback.</p>

<p>"Why, perhaps you'll deny that you wrote and told
me all you said," interrupted Titmouse, indignantly, feeling
in his pocket for Huckaback's letter, which that worthy
had at the moment quite forgotten having sent, and
on being reminded of it, he certainly seemed rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
nonplussed. "Oh&mdash;ay, if you mean <i>that</i>&mdash;hem!"&mdash;he stammered.</p>

<p>"Come, you <i>know</i> you're a liar, Huck&mdash;but it's no
good now: liar or no liar, it's all over."</p>

<p>"The pot and kettle, anyhow, Tit, as far as that goes&mdash;hem!&mdash;but
let's spell over this letter; we haven't
studied it yet; I'm a hand, rather, at getting at what's
said in a letter!&mdash;Come"&mdash;and they drew their chairs
together, Huckaback reading over the letter slowly, alone;
Titmouse's eyes travelling incessantly from his friend's
countenance to the letter, and so back again, to gather
what might be the effect of its perusal.</p>

<p>"There's a glimpse of daylight yet, Titty!" said
Huckaback, as he concluded reading it.</p>

<p>"No! But is there really? Do tell me, Hucky"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, first and foremost, how uncommon polite they
are, (except that they haven't manners enough to spell
my name right)"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Really&mdash;and so they are!" exclaimed Titmouse,
rather elatedly.</p>

<p>"And then, you see, there's another thing&mdash;if they'd
meant to give the thing the go-by altogether, what could
have been easier than to say so?&mdash;but they haven't said
anything of the sort, so they don't <i>mean</i> to give it all up!"</p>

<p>"Lord, Huck! what would I give for such a head as
yours! What you say is quite true," said Titmouse,
still more cheerfully.</p>

<p>"To be sure, they do say there's an <i>obstacle</i>&mdash;an
obstacle, you see&mdash;nay, it's obstacles, which is several,
and that"&mdash;&mdash; Titmouse's face fell.</p>

<p>"But they say again, that it's&mdash;it's&mdash;curse their big
words&mdash;they say it's&mdash;to be got over in time."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;that's something, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"To be sure it is; and a'n't anything better than nothing?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
But then, again, here's a stone in the other pocket&mdash;they
say there's a <i>circumstance</i>!&mdash;don't you hate circumstances,
Titty?&mdash;I do."</p>

<p>"So do I!&mdash;What does it mean? I've often heard&mdash;isn't
it a <i>thing</i>? And that may be&mdash;anything."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's a great dif&mdash;hem! And they go on to
say it's happened since you was there"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Curse me, then, if that don't mean <i>you</i>, Huckaback!"
interrupted Titmouse, with returning anger.</p>

<p>"No, that can't be it; they said they'd no control over
the circumstance;&mdash;now they <i>had</i> over me; for they ordered
me to the door, and I went; a'n't that so, Titty?&mdash;Lord,
how my eye <i>does</i> smart, to be sure!"</p>

<p>"And don't I smart all over, inside and out, if it comes
to that?" inquired Titmouse, dolefully.</p>

<p>"There's nothing particular in the rest of the letter&mdash;only
uncommon civil, and saying if anything turns up you
shall hear."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> could make that out myself&mdash;so there's nothing
in that"&mdash;said Titmouse, quickly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if it <i>is</i> all over&mdash;what a pity! Such things
as we could have done, Titty, if we'd got the thing&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>Titmouse groaned at this glimpse of the heaven he
seemed shut out of forever.</p>

<p>"Can't you find anything&mdash;nothing at all comfortable-like,
in the letter?" he inquired with a deep sigh.</p>

<p>Huckaback again took up the letter and spelled it over.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, striving to give himself an appearance
of thinking, "there's something in it that, after all, I
don't seem quite to get to the bottom of&mdash;they've seemingly
taken a deal of pains with it!"</p>

<p>[And undoubtedly it <i>was</i> a document which had been
pretty well considered by its framers before being sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
out; though, probably, they had hardly anticipated its
being so soon afterwards subjected to the scrutiny of
such acute intellects as were now engaged upon it.]</p>

<p>"And then, again, you know they're lawyers; and
do <i>they</i> ever write anything that hasn't got more in it
than anybody can find out? These gents that wrote this,
they're a trick too keen for the thieves even&mdash;and how
can <i>we</i>&mdash;hem!&mdash;but I wonder if that fat, old, bald-headed
gent, with sharp eyes, was Mr. Quirk"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"To be sure it was," interrupted Titmouse, with a
half shudder.</p>

<p>"Was it? Well, then, I'd advise Old Nick to look
sharp before he tackles that old gent, that's all!"</p>

<p>"Give me Mr. Gammon for my money," said Titmouse,
sighing, "such an <i>uncommon</i> gentlemanlike gent&mdash;he's
quite taken to me"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, that, I suppose, was him with the black velvet
waistcoat, and pretty white hands! But <i>he</i> can look
stern, too, Tit! You should have seen him ring, when&mdash;hem!&mdash;But
what was I saying about the letter?
Don't you see they say they'll be sure to write if anything
turns up?"</p>

<p>"So they do, to be sure! Well&mdash;I'd forgot that!"
interrupted Titmouse, brightening up.</p>

<p>"Then, isn't there their advertisement in the <i>Flash</i>?
They hadn't their eye on anything when they put it
there, I dare say!&mdash;They can't get out of <i>that</i>, anyhow!"</p>

<p>"I begin to feel all of a sweat, Hucky; I'm sure
there's something in the wind yet!" said Titmouse,
drawing nearer still to his comforter. "And more than
that&mdash;would they have said half they did to me last night"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Eh! hollo, by the way! I've not heard of what
went on last night! So you went to 'em? Well&mdash;tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
us all that happened&mdash;and nothing but the truth, be <i>sure</i>
you don't; come, Titty!" said Huckaback, snuffing the
candle, and then turning eagerly to his companion.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;they'd such a number of queer-looking papers
before them, some with old German-text writing,
and others with zigzag marks&mdash;and they were so uncommon
polite&mdash;they all three got up as I went in,
and made me bows, one after the other, and said, 'Yours
most obediently, Mr. Titmouse,' and a great many more
such things."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;and then?"</p>

<p>"Why, Hucky, so help me&mdash;&mdash;! and 'pon my soul,
that old gent, Mr. Quirk, told me"&mdash;Titmouse's voice
trembled at the recollection&mdash;"he says, 'Sir, you're the
real owner of Ten Thousand a-year, and no mistake!'"</p>

<p>"Lawks!" ejaculated Huckaback, opening wider and
wider his eyes and ears as his friend went on.</p>

<p>"'And a title&mdash;a <i>lord</i>, or something of that sort&mdash;and
you've a great many country seats; and there's
been £10,000 a-year saving up for you ever since you
was born&mdash;and heaps of interest besides!'&mdash;'pon my
soul he did!"</p>

<p>"Lord, Tit! you take my breath away," gasped Huckaback,
his eyes fixed intently on his friend's face.</p>

<p>"Yes; and they said I might marry the most beautifulest
woman that ever my eyes saw, for the asking."</p>

<p>"You'll forget poor Bob Huckaback, Tit!" murmured
his friend, despondingly.</p>

<p>"Not I, Huckaback&mdash;if I get my rights, and you
know how to behave yourself!"</p>

<p>"Have you been to Tag-rag's to-day, after hearing all
this?"</p>

<p>[The thermometer seemed to have been here plunged
out of hot water into cold&mdash;Titmouse was down at zero
in a trice.]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;that's it! 'Tis all gone again! What a fool
I am! We've clean forgot this cursed letter&mdash;and that
leads me to the end of what took place last night. That
cursed shop was what we split on!"</p>

<p>"Split on <i>the shop</i>! eh? What's the meaning of that?"
inquired Huckaback, with eager anxiety.</p>

<p>"Why, that's the thing," continued Titmouse, in a faltering
tone, and with a depressed look&mdash;"That was what
I wanted to know myself; for they said I'd better go
back!! So I said, 'Gents,' said I, 'I'll be&mdash;&mdash; if I'll
go back to the shop any more;' and I snapped my fingers
at them&mdash;so! (for you know what a chap I am
when my blood's up.) And they all turned gashly pale&mdash;they
did, upon my life&mdash;you never saw anything
like it! And one of them said then, in a humble way,
'Wouldn't I please to go back to the shop, just for a
day or two, till things is got to rights a bit.' 'Not a
day nor a minute!' says I, in an immense rage. 'We
think you'd better, really,' said they. 'Then,' says I, 'if
that's your plan, curse me if I won't cut with you all,
and I'll employ some one else!' and&mdash;would you believe
me?&mdash;out I went, bang! into the street!!"</p>

<p>"You <i>did</i>, Tit!!" echoed Huckaback, aghast.</p>

<p>"They shouldn't have given me so much brandy and
water as they did; I didn't well know what I was about,
what with the news and the spirits!"</p>

<p>"And you went into the street?" inquired Huckaback,
with a kind of horror.</p>

<p>"I did, by Jove, Hucky!"</p>

<p>"They'd given you the sperrits to see what kind of
chap you'd be if you got the property&mdash;only to try you,
depend on it!"</p>

<p>"Lord! I&mdash;I dare say they did!" exclaimed Titmouse,
elevating his head with sudden amazement,
totally forgetting that same brandy and water he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
had asked for&mdash;"and me never to think of it at the time."</p>

<p>"Now are you quite sure you wasn't in a <i>dream</i> last
night, all the while?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I wish I had been&mdash;I do, indeed, Hucky!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you went into the street&mdash;what then?" inquired
Huckaback, with a sigh of exhausted attention.</p>

<p>"Why, when I'd got there, I could have bitten my
tongue off, as one may suppose; but, just as I was a-turning
to go in again, who should come up to me but
Mr. Gammon, saying, he humbly hoped there was no offence."</p>

<p>"Oh, glorious! So it was all set right again, then&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I&mdash;I can't quite exactly say that much,
either&mdash;but&mdash;when I went back, (being obligated by
Mr. Gammon being so pressing,) the other two was sitting
as pale as death; and though Mr. Gammon and me
went on our knees to the old gent, it wasn't any use for
a long time; and all that he could be got to say was,
that perhaps I might look in again to-night&mdash;(but they
first made me swear a solemn oath on the Bible never to
tell any one anything about the fortune)&mdash;and then&mdash;you
went, Huckaback, and you did the business; they
of course concluding I'd sent you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, bother! that can't be. Don't you see how civilly
they speak of me in their letter? They're afraid of
me, you may depend on it. By the way, Tit, how much
did you promise to come down, if you got the thing?"</p>

<p>"<i>Come down!</i>&mdash;I&mdash;really&mdash;by Jove, I didn't think
of such a thing! No&mdash;I'm sure I didn't"&mdash;answered
Titmouse, as if new light had burst in upon him.</p>

<p>"Why, Tit, I never see'd such a goose! That's it,
depend upon it&mdash;it's the whole thing! That's what
they're driving at, in the note!&mdash;Why, Tit, where <i>was</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
your wits? D'&nbsp;ye think such gents as them&mdash;great lawyers,
too&mdash;will work for nothing?&mdash;You must write at
once and tell them you will come down handsome&mdash;say
a couple of hundreds, besides expenses&mdash;Gad! 'twill set
you on your pins again, Titty!&mdash;Rot me! now I think
of it, if I didn't dream last night that you was a Member
of Parliament or something of that sort."</p>

<p>"A member of Parliament! And so I shall, if all this
turns up well&mdash;I shall be <i>that</i> at least!" replied
Titmouse, exultingly.</p>

<p>"You see if my dream don't come true! You see,
Titty, I'm <i>always</i> a-thinking of you, day and night.
Never was two fellows that was such close friends as we
was from the very beginning of knowing each other!"</p>

<p>[They had been acquainted with each other about half a year.]</p>

<p>"Hucky, what a cruel scamp I was to behave to you
in the way I did&mdash;curse me, if I couldn't cry to see
your eye bunged up in that way!"</p>

<p>"Pho! dear Titty, I knew you loved me all the while"&mdash;whined
Huckaback, "and meant no harm; you wasn't
yourself when you did it&mdash;and besides, I deserved ten
times more! If you had killed me I should have liked
you as much as ever!"</p>

<p>"Give us your hand, Hucky! Let's forgive one another!"
cried Titmouse, excitedly; and their hands were
quickly locked together.</p>

<p>"If we don't mismanage the thing, we shall be all right
yet, Titty; but you won't do anything without speaking
to <i>me</i> first&mdash;will you, Titty?"</p>

<p>"The thoughts of it all going right again is enough to
set me wild, Hucky&mdash;But what shall we do to set the
thing going again?"</p>

<p>"<i>Quarter past one!</i>" quivered the voice of the paralytic
watchman beneath, startling the friends out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
their exciting colloquy; his warning being at the same
time silently seconded by the long-wicked candle, burning
within half an inch of its socket. They hastily agreed
that Titmouse should immediately write to Messrs. Quirk,
Gammon, and Snap, a proper [<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> a most abject] letter,
solemnly pledging himself to obey their injunctions in
everything for the future, and offering them a handsome
reward for their exertions, if successful.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;good-night, Huck! good-night," said Titmouse,
rising. "I'm not the least sleepy&mdash;I sha'n't
sleep a wink all night long! I shall sit up to write my
letter&mdash;you haven't got a sheet of paper here, by the
way?&mdash;I've used all mine." [That was, he had, some
months before, bought a sheet to write a letter, and had
so used it.]</p>

<p>Huckaback produced a sheet, somewhat crumpled,
from a drawer. "I'd give a hundred if I had them!"
said he; "I sha'n't care a straw for the hiding I've
got to-night&mdash;though I'm a <i>leetle</i> sore after it, too&mdash;and
what the deuce am I to say to-morrow to Messrs. Diaper"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, you can't hardly be at a loss for a lie that'll suit
<i>them</i>, surely!&mdash;So good-night, Hucky&mdash;good-night!"</p>

<p>Huckaback wrung his friend's hand, and was in a moment
or two alone. "Haven't my fingers been itching
all the while to be at the fellow!" exclaimed he, as he
shut the door. "But, somehow, I've got too soft a sperrit,
and can't bear to hurt any one;&mdash;and then&mdash;if the
chap gets his £10,000 a-year&mdash;why&mdash;hem! Titty a'n't
such a bad fellow, in the main, after all."</p>

<p>If Titmouse had been many degrees higher in the
grade of society, <i>he would still have met with his Huckaback</i>;&mdash;a
trifle more polished, perhaps, but hardly more
quicksighted or effective than, in his way, had been the
vulgar being he had just quitted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Titmouse hastened homeward. How it was he knew
not; but the feelings of elation with which he had
quitted Huckaback did not last long; they rapidly sank,
in the cold night-air, lower and lower, the farther he got
from Leicester Square. He tried to recollect <i>what it was</i>
that had made him take so very different a view of his
affairs from that with which he had entered Huckaback's
room. He had still a vague impression that they were
not desperate; that Huckaback had told him so, <i>and
somehow proved it</i>; but how he now knew not&mdash;he could
not recollect. As Huckaback had gone on from time to
time, Titmouse's little mind seemed to himself to comprehend
and appreciate what was being said, and to
gather encouragement from it; but <i>now</i>&mdash;consume it!&mdash;he
stopped&mdash;rubbed his forehead&mdash;what the deuce
<span class="smcap">was</span> it? By the time that he had reached his own door,
he felt in as deplorable and despairing a humor as ever.
He sat down to write his letter at once; but, after many
vain efforts to express his meaning&mdash;his feelings being
not in the least degree relieved by the many oaths he
uttered&mdash;he at length furiously dashed his pen, point-wise,
upon the table, and thereby destroyed the only implement
of the sort which he possessed. Then he tore,
rather than pulled off, his clothes; blew out his candle
with a furious <i>puff</i>; and threw himself on his bed&mdash;but
in so doing banged the back of his head against the back
of the bed&mdash;and which of the two suffered more, for
some time after, probably Mr. Titmouse was best able
to tell.</p>

<p>Hath, then&mdash;oh, Titmouse! fated to undergo much!&mdash;the
blind jade Fortune, in her mad vagaries&mdash;she, the
goddess whom thou hast so long foolishly worshipped&mdash;at
length cast her sportful eye upon thee, and singled
thee out to become the envy of millions of admiring fools,
by reason of the pranks she will presently make thee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
exhibit for her amusement? If this be indeed, as at
present it promises, her intent, she truly, to me calmly
watching her movements, appears resolved first to wreak
her spite upon thee to the uttermost, and make thee
pass through intense sufferings! Oh me! Oh me!
Alas!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>The means by which Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and
Snap, became possessed of the important information
which had put them into motion, as we have seen, to
find out by advertisement one yet unknown to them, it
will not be necessary for some time to explain. Theirs
was a keen house, truly, and dealing principally in the
criminal line of business; and they would not, one may
be sure, have lightly committed themselves to their present
extent, namely, in inserting such an advertisement
in the newspapers, and, above all, going so far in their
disclosures to Titmouse. Their prudence in the latter
step, however, was very questionable to themselves even;
and they immediately afterwards deplored together the
precipitation with which Mr. Quirk had communicated to
Titmouse the nature and extent of his possible good fortune.
It was Mr. Quirk's own doing, however, and done
after as much expostulation as the cautious Gammon could
venture to use. I say they had not <i>lightly</i> taken up the
affair; they had not "acted unadvisedly." They were
fortified, first, by the opinion of Mr. <span class="smcap">Mortmain</span>, an able
and experienced conveyancer, who thus wound up an abstrusely
learned opinion on the voluminous "case" which
had been submitted to him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"...Under all these circumstances, and assuming as above,
I am decidedly of opinion that the title to the estates in question
is at this moment not in their present possessor, (who represents
the younger branch of the Dreddlington family,) but in the descendants
of Stephen Dreddlington, through the female line;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
which brings us to Gabriel Tittlebat Titmouse. This person,
however, seems not to have been at all aware of the existence of
his rights, or he could hardly have been concerned in the pecuniary
arrangements mentioned at fol. 33 of the case. Probably
something may be heard of his heir by making careful inquiry
in the neighborhood where he was last heard of, and issuing
advertisements for his heir-at-law; care, of course, being taken
not to be so specific in the terms of such advertisements as to attract
the notice of A. B., (the party now in possession.) If such
person should, by the means above suggested, be discovered, I
advise proceedings to be commenced forthwith, under the advice
of some gentleman of experience at the common-law bar.</p>

<p class='sigr' style='margin-left:2em;'>"<span class="smcap">Mouldy Mortmain.</span></p>

<p>"<i>Lincoln's Inn, January</i> 19, 18&mdash;."</p></div>

<p>This was sufficiently gratifying to the "house;" but, to
make assurance doubly sure, before embarking in so harassing
and expensive an enterprise&mdash;one which lay a good
deal, too, without the sphere of their practice, which as
already mentioned, was chiefly in criminal law&mdash;the same
<i>case</i> (without Mr. Mortmain's opinion) was laid before a
young conveyancer, who, having much less business than
Mr. Mortmain, would, it was thought, "look into the case
fully," though receiving only one-third of the fee which
had been paid to Mr. Mortmain. And Mr. <span class="smcap">Fussy
Frankpledge</span>&mdash;that was his name&mdash;<i>did</i> "look into the case
fully;" and in doing so, turned over two-thirds of his little
library;&mdash;and also gleaned&mdash;by note and verbally&mdash;the
opinions upon the subject of some half-dozen of his
"learned friends;" to say nothing of the magnificent air
with which he indoctrinated his eager and confiding pupils
upon the subject. At length his imp of a clerk bore the
precious result of his master's labors to Saffron Hill, in
the shape of an "opinion," three times as long as, and indescribably
more difficult to understand than, the opinion
of Mr. Mortmain; and which if it demonstrated anything
beyond the prodigious <i>cram</i> which had been undergone by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
its writer for the purpose of producing it, demonstrated
this&mdash;namely, that neither the party indicated by Mr.
Mortmain, nor the one then actually in possession, had any
more right to the estate than the aforesaid Mr. Frankpledge;
but that the happy individual so entitled was
some third person. Messrs. Quirk and Gammon, a good
deal flustered hereat, hummed and hawed on perusing
these contradictory opinions of counsel learned in the
law; and the usual and proper result followed&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> a
"<span class="smcap">consultation</span>," which was to solder up all the differences
between Mr. Mortmain and Mr. Frankpledge, or,
at all events, strike out some light which might guide
their clients on their adventurous way.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Mortmain had been Mr. Quirk's conveyancer
(whenever such a functionary's services had been required)
for about twenty years; and Quirk was ready to
suffer death in defence of any opinion of Mr. Mortmain.
Mr. Gammon swore by Frankpledge, who had been at
school with him, and was a "rising man." Mortmain
belonged to the old school&mdash;Frankpledge steered by the
new lights. The former could point to some forty cases
in the Law Reports, which had been ruled in conformity
with his previously given opinion, and some twenty which
had been overruled thereby; the latter gentleman, although
he had been only five years in practice, had
written an <i>opinion</i> which had led to a suit&mdash;which had
ended in a difference of opinion between the Court of
King's Bench and the Common Pleas; the credit of
having done which was, however, some time afterward,
a little bit tarnished by the decision of a Court of Error,
without hearing the other side, <i>against</i> the opinion of Mr.
Frankpledge. But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Frankpledge quoted <i>so</i> many cases, and went to
the bottom of everything, and gave so much for his
money&mdash;and was <i>so</i> civil!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, the consultation came off, at length, at Mr. Mortmain's
chambers, at eight o'clock in the evening. A few
minutes before that hour, Messrs. Quirk and Gammon
were to be seen in the clerk's room, in civil conversation
with that prim functionary, who explained to them that
<i>he</i> did all Mr. Mortmain's drafting&mdash;pupils were <i>so</i> idle;
that Mr. Mortmain did not score out much of what he
(the aforesaid clerk) had drawn; that he noted up Mr.
Mortmain's new cases for him in the reports, Mr. M.
having so little time; and that the other day the Vice-Chancellor
called on Mr. Mortmain&mdash;with several other
matters of that sort, calculated to enhance the importance
of Mr. Mortmain; who, as the clerk was asking Mr. Gammon,
in a good-natured way, how long Mr. Frankpledge
had been in practice, and where his chambers were&mdash;made
his appearance, with a cheerful look and a bustling
gait, having just walked down from his house in Queen's
Square, with a comfortable bottle of old port on board.
Shortly afterwards Mr. Frankpledge arrived, followed by
his little clerk, bending beneath two bags of books, (unconscious
bearer of as much law as had well-nigh split
thousands of learned heads, and broken tens of thousands
of hearts, in the making of, being destined to have
a similar but far greater effect in the applying of,)
and the consultation began.</p>

<p>As Frankpledge entered, he could not help casting a
sheep's eye towards a table that glistened with <i>such</i> an
array of "papers," (a tasteful arrangement of Mr. Mortmain's
clerk before every consultation;) and down sat
the two conveyancers and the two attorneys. I devoutly
wish I had time to describe the scene at length; but
greater events are pressing upon me. The two conveyancers
fenced with one another for some time very guardedly
and good-humoredly: pleasant was it to observe the
conscious condescension of Mortmain, the anxious energy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and volubility of Frankpledge. When Mr. Mortmain
said anything that seemed weighty or pointed, Quirk
looked with an elated air, a quick triumphant glance, at
Gammon; who, in his turn, whenever Mr. Frankpledge
quoted an "old case" from Bendloe, Godbolt, or the Year
Books, (which, having always piqued himself on his almost
exclusive acquaintance with the modern cases, he
made a point of doing,) gazed at Quirk with a smile of
placid superiority. Mr. Frankpledge talked almost the
whole time; Mr. Mortmain, immovable in the view of the
case which he had taken in his "opinion," listened with
an attentive, good-natured air, ruminating pleasantly the
while upon the quality of the port he had been drinking,
(the first of the bin which he had tasted,) and upon the
decision which the Chancellor might come to on a case
brought into court on his advice, and which had been
argued that afternoon. At last Frankpledge unwittingly
fell foul of a favorite crotchet of Mortmain's&mdash;and at it
they went, hammer and tongs, for nearly twenty minutes,
(it had nothing whatever to do with the case they were
consulting upon.) In the end, Mortmain of course adhered
to his points, and Frankpledge intrenched himself
in his books; each slightly yielded to the views of the
other on immaterial points, (or what would have appeared
the use of the consultation?) but did that which both
had resolved upon doing from the first, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> sticking to
his original opinion. Both had talked an amazing deal
of deep law, which had at least one effect, viz. it fairly
drowned both Quirk and Gammon, who, as they went
home, with not (it must be owned) the clearest perceptions
in the world of what had been going on, (though,
before going to the consultation, each had really known
something about the case,) stood each stoutly by his conveyancer's
opinion, each protesting that he had never
been once misled&mdash;Quirk by Mortmain, or Gammon by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Frankpledge&mdash;and each resolved to give <i>his</i> man more
of the conveyancing business of the house than he had
before. I grieve to add, that they parted that night with
a trifle less of cordiality than had been their wont. In
the morning, however, this little irritation had passed
away; and they agreed, before giving up the case, to
take the final opinion of Mr. <span class="smcap">Tresayle</span>&mdash;the great Mr.
Tresayle. He was, indeed, a wonderful conveyancer&mdash;a
perfect miracle of real-property law-learning. He had
had such an enormous practice for forty-five years, that
for the last ten he had never put his nose out of chambers
for pure want of time, and at last of inclination; and had
been so conversant with Norman French and law Latin,
in the old English letter, that he had almost entirely
forgotten how to write the modern English character.
His opinions made their appearance in three different
kinds of handwriting. First, one that none but he and
his old clerk could make out; secondly, one that none
but he himself could read; and thirdly, one that neither
he, nor his clerk, nor any one on earth, could decipher.
The use of any one of these styles depended on&mdash;the
difficulty of the case to be answered. If it were an easy
one, the answer was very judiciously put into No. I.; if
rather difficult, it, of course, went into No. II.; and if
exceedingly difficult, (and also important,) it was very
properly thrown into No. III.; being a question that
really ought not to have been asked, and did not deserve
an answer. The fruit within these uncouth shells, however,
was precious. Mr. Tresayle's law was supreme over
everybody's else. It was currently reported that Lord
Eldon even (who was himself slightly acquainted with
such subjects) reverently deferred to the authority of Mr.
Tresayle; and would lie winking and knitting his shaggy
eyebrows half the night, if he thought that Mr. Tresayle's
opinion on a case, and his own, differed. This was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
great authority to whom, as in the last resort, Messrs.
Quirk, Gammon, and Snap resolved to appeal. To his
chambers they, within a day or two after their consultation
at Mr. Mortmain's, despatched their case, (making no
mention of the opinion which had been previously taken,)
with a highly respectable fee, and a special compliment to
his clerk, hoping to hear from that awful quarter within
a month&mdash;which was the earliest average period within
which Mr. Tresayle's opinions found their way to his patient
but anxious clients. It came at length, with a note
from Mr. Prim, his clerk, intimating that they would
find him, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the aforesaid Mr. Prim, at his chambers the
next morning, prepared to explain the opinion to them;
having just had it read over to him by Mr. Tresayle, for
it proved to be in No. II. The opinion occupied about
two pages; and the handwriting bore a strong resemblance
to Chinese or Arabic, with a quaint intermixture
of the uncial Greek character&mdash;it was impossible to contemplate
it without a certain feeling of awe! In vain did
old Quirk squint at it, from all corners, for nearly a couple
of hours, (having first called in the assistance of a friend
of his, an old attorney of upwards of fifty years' standing;)
nay&mdash;even Mr. Gammon, foiled at length, could
not for the life of him refrain from a soft curse or two.
Neither of them could make anything of it&mdash;(as for
Snap, they never showed it to him; it was not within his
province&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Insolvent Debtors' Court, the Old
Bailey, the Clerkenwell Sessions, the Police Offices, the
inferior business of the Common Law Courts, and the
worrying of the clerks of the office&mdash;a department in
which he was perfection itself.)</p>

<p>To their great delight, Mr. Tresayle took Mr. Mortmain's
view of the case. Nothing could be more terse,
perspicuous, and conclusive than the great man's opinion.
Mr. Quirk was in raptures, and that very day sent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
procure an engraving of Mr. Tresayle, which had lately
come out, for which he paid 5s., and ordered it to be
framed and hung up in his own room, where already
grinned a quaint resemblance, in black profile, of Mr.
Mortmain, cheek by jowl with that of a notorious traitor
who had been hanged in spite of Mr. Quirk's best
exertions. In special good-humor, he assured Mr. Gammon,
(who was plainly somewhat crestfallen about Mr.
Frankpledge,) that everybody must have a beginning;
that even he himself (Mr. Quirk) had been once only
a beginner.</p>

<p>Once fairly on the scent, Messrs. Quirk and Gammon
soon began, secretly but energetically, to push their inquiries
in all directions. They discovered that Gabriel Tittlebat
Titmouse, having spent the chief portion of his
blissful days as a cobbler at Whitehaven, had died in
London, somewhere about the year 1793. At this point
they stood for a long while, in spite of two advertisements,
to which they had been driven with the greatest
reluctance, for fear of attracting the attention of those
most interested in thwarting their efforts. Even that
part of the affair had been managed somewhat skilfully.
It was a stroke of Mr. Gammon's to advertise not for
"Heir-at-Law," but "<i>Next of Kin</i>," as the reader has
seen. The former might have challenged the notice of
unfriendly curiosity, which the latter was hardly calculated
to attract. At length&mdash;at the "third time of asking"&mdash;up
turned Tittlebat Titmouse, in the way which
we have seen. His relationship with Mr. Gabriel Tittlebat
Titmouse was indisputable; in fact, he was (to adopt
his own words) that "deceased person's" son and heir-at-law.</p>

<p>The reader may guess the chagrin and disgust of Mr.
Gammon at the appearance, manners, and character of
the person whom he fully believed, on first seeing him at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Messrs. Tag-rag's, to be the rightful owner of the fine
estates held by one who, as against Mr. Titmouse, had no
more real title to them than had Mr. Tag-rag; and for
whom their house was to undertake the very grave risk
and expense of instituting such proceedings as would
be requisite to place Mr. Titmouse in the position which
they believed him entitled to occupy&mdash;having to encounter
a hot and desperate opposition at every point,
from those who had nine-tenths of the law&mdash;to wit,
<i>possession</i>&mdash;on their side, on which they stood as upon a
rock; and with immense means for carrying on the war
defensive. That Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap did
not contemplate undertaking all this, without having
calculated upon its proving well worthy their while, was
only reasonable. They were going voluntarily to become
the means of conferring immense benefits upon one who
was a total stranger to them&mdash;who had not a penny to
spend upon the prosecution of his own rights. Setting
aside certain difficulties which collected themselves into
two awkward words, <span class="smcap">Maintenance</span> and <span class="smcap">Champerty</span>, and
stared them in the face whenever they contemplated any
obvious method of securing the just reward of their enterprise
and toils&mdash;setting aside all this, I say, it might
turn out, only after a ruinous expenditure had been incurred,
that the high authorities which had sanctioned
their proceedings in point of law, had expressed their
favorable opinions on a state of facts, which, however satisfactorily
they looked on paper, could not be substantiated,
if keenly sifted, and determinedly resisted. All
this, too&mdash;all their time, labor, and money, to go for
nothing&mdash;on behalf of a vulgar, selfish, ignorant, presumptuous,
ungrateful puppy, like Titmouse!&mdash;Well indeed,
therefore, might Mr. Gammon, as we have seen he
did, give himself and partners a forty-eight hours' interval,
between his interview with Titmouse and formal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
introduction of him to the firm, in which to consider
their position and mode of procedure. The taste of his
quality which that first interview afforded them all&mdash;so
far surpassing all that the bitter description of him given
to them by Mr. Gammon had prepared them for&mdash;filled
the partners with inexpressible disgust, and would have
induced them to throw up the whole affair&mdash;so getting
rid both of it, and of him, together. But then, on the
other hand, there were certain very great advantages,
both of a professional and even directly pecuniary kind,
which it would have been madness indeed for any office
lightly to throw away. It was really, after all, an unequal
struggle between feeling and interest. If they
should succeed in unseating the present wrongful possessor
of a very splendid property, and putting in his
place the rightful owner, by means alone of their own
professional ability, perseverance, and heavy pecuniary
outlay, (a fearful consideration, truly, but Mr. Quirk had
scraped together some thirty thousand pounds!) what
recompense could be too great for such resplendent services?
To say nothing of the <i>éclat</i> which it would gain
for their office, in the profession and in the world at
large, and the substantial and permanent advantages to
the firm, if, as they ought to be, they were intrusted with
the general management of the property by the new and
inexperienced and confiding owner&mdash;ay, but there was
the rub! What a disheartening and disgusting specimen
of such new owner had disclosed itself to their
anxiously expecting but soon recoiling eyes&mdash;always,
however, making due allowances for one or two cheering
indications, on Mr. Titmouse's part, of a certain rapacious
and litigious humor, which might hereafter right pleasantly
and profitably occupy their energies! Their professional
position, and their interests had long made them
sharp observers; but when did ever before low and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
disgusting qualities force themselves into revolting prominence,
as those of Mr. Titmouse had done, in the very
moment of an expected display of the better feelings of
human nature&mdash;such as enthusiastic gratitude? They
had, in their time, had to deal with some pleasant specimens
of humanity, to be sure; but when with any more
odious and impracticable than Tittlebat Titmouse threatened
to prove himself? What hold could they get upon
such a character as his? Beneath all his coarseness
and weakness, there was a glimmer of low cunning which
might suffice to keep their superior and practised astuteness
at its full stretch. These were difficulties, cheerless
enough in the contemplation, truly; but, nevertheless,
the partners could not bear the idea of escaping from
them by throwing up the affair altogether. Then came
the question&mdash;How were they to manage Mr. Titmouse?&mdash;how
acquire an early and firm hold of him, so as
to convert him into a <i>capital client</i>? His fears and
his interests were obviously the engines with which
their experienced hands were to work; and several long
and most anxious consultations had Messrs. Quirk and
Gammon had on this important matter. The first
great question with them was&mdash;To what extent, and
when, they should acquaint him with the nature of
his expectations.</p>

<p>Gammon was for keeping him comparatively in the
dark, till success was within reach: during that interval,
(which might be a long one,) by alternately stimulating
his hopes and fears; by habituating him to an entire dependence
on them; by persuading him of the prodigious
extent of their exertions and sacrifices on his behalf&mdash;they
<i>might</i> do something; mould him into a shape fit
for their purposes, and persuade him that his affairs must
needs go to ruin but in their hands. Something like this
was the scheme of the cautious, acute, and placid Gammon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Mr. Quirk, however, (with whom, as will be hereafter
shown, had originated the whole discovery,) thought
thus:&mdash;tell the fellow at once the whole extent of what
we can do for him, viz. turn a half-starving linen-draper's
shopman into the owner of £10,000 a-year, and of a
great store of ready money. This will, in a manner,
stun him into submission, and make him at once and for
all what we want him to be. He will immediately fall
prostrate with reverent gratitude&mdash;looking at us, moreover,
as three gods, who, at our will, can shut him out
of heaven. "<i>That's</i> the way to bring down your bird,"
said Mr. Quirk; and Mr. Quirk had been forty years in
practice&mdash;had made the business what it was&mdash;still
held half of it in his own hands, (two-thirds of the remaining
half being Gammon's, and the residue Snap's:)
and Gammon, moreover, had a very distinct perception
that the funds for carrying on the war would come out
of the tolerably well-stored pockets of the august head of
the firm. So, after a long discussion, he openly yielded
his opinion to that of Mr. Quirk&mdash;cherishing, however, a
very warm respect for it in his own bosom. As for Snap,
that distinguished member of the firm was very little consulted
in the matter; which had not yet been brought to
that stage where his powerful energies could come into
play. He had of course, however, heard a good deal of
what was going on; and knew that ere long there would
be the copying out and serving of the Lord knows how
many copies of declarations in ejectment, motions against
the casual ejector, and so forth&mdash;so far at least as he
was "up to" all those quaint and anomalous proceedings.
It had, therefore, been at length agreed that the communication
to Titmouse, on his first interview, of the full
extent of his splendid expectations, should depend upon
the discretion of Mr. Quirk. The reader has seen the unexpected
turn which matters took upon that important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
occasion; and if it proved Quirk's policy to be somewhat
inferior in point of discretion and long-sightedness to
that of Gammon, still it must be owned that the latter
had cause to admire the rapid generalship with which
Mr. Quirk had obviated the consequences of his false
move&mdash;not ill seconded by Snap. What could have
been more judicious than his reception of Titmouse, on
the occasion of his being led in again by the subtle Gammon?</p>

<p>The next and greatest matter was, how to obtain any
hold upon such a person as Titmouse had shown himself,
so as to secure to themselves, in the event of success, the
remuneration to which they considered themselves entitled.
Was it so perfectly clear that, if he felt disposed
to resist it, they could compel him to pay the mere
amount of their bill of costs?</p>

<p>Suppose he should turn round upon them, and have
their <span class="smcap">Bill taxed</span>&mdash;Mr. Quirk grunted with fright at the
bare thought. Then there was a slapping <i>quiddam honorarium</i>
extra&mdash;undoubtedly for <i>that</i> they must, they feared,
trust to the honor and gratitude of Mr. Titmouse; and a
pretty taste of the quality of that animal they had already
experienced! Such a disposition as <i>his</i>, to have to rely
upon for the prompt settlement of a bill of thousands of
pounds of costs! and, besides that, to have it to look
to for the payment of at least some five or perhaps ten
thousand pounds <i>douceur</i>&mdash;nay, and this was not all.
Mr. Quirk had, as well as Mr. Gammon, cast many an
anxious eye on the following passages from <i>Blackstone's
Commentaries</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Maintenance</span> is an officious intermeddling in a suit that
no way belongs to one, by 'maintaining' or assisting either
party with money, or otherwise, to prosecute or defend it....
It is an offence against public justice, as it keeps alive strife
and contention, and perverts the remedial process of the law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
into an engine of oppression.... The punishment by common
law is fine and imprisonment, and by statute 32 Hen. VIII.
c. 9, a forfeiture of £10!</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Champerty</span>&mdash;(<i>campi partitio</i>)&mdash;is a species of Maintenance,
and punished in the same manner; being a bargain with
a plaintiff or defendant '<i>campum partiri</i>,' to divide the land, or
other matter sued for, between them, if they prevail at law;
whereupon the champertor is to carry on the suit at his own
expense.... These pests of civil society, that are perpetually
endeavoring to disturb the repose of their neighbors, and officiously
interfering in other men's quarrels, even at the hazard
of their own fortunes, were severely animadverted on by the
Roman law; and they were punished by the forfeiture of a
third part of their goods, and perpetual infamy."[<a href='#Note_4'>4</a>]</p></div>

<p>These were pleasant passages surely!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Many were the conversations and consultations which
the partners had had with Messrs. Mortmain and Frankpledge
respectively, upon the interesting question, whether
there were any mode of at once securing themselves against
the ingratitude of Titmouse, and protecting themselves
against the penalties of the law. It made old Mr. Quirk's
bald head, even, flush all over whenever he thought of
their bill being taxed, or contemplated himself the inmate
of a prison, (above all, at his advanced time of life,) with
mournful leisure to meditate upon the misdeeds that had
sent him thither, to which profitable exercise the legislature
would have specially stimulated him by a certain <i>fine</i>
above mentioned. As for Gammon, he knew there <i>must</i>
be a way of doing the thing somehow or another; for
his friend Frankpledge felt infinitely less difficulty in the
way than Mortmain, whom he considered a timid and old-fashioned
practitioner. The courts, said Mr. Frankpledge,
were now setting their faces strongly against the doctrine
of Maintenance, as being founded on a bygone state of
things: <i>cessante ratione cessat et ipsa lex</i>, was his favorite
maxim. There was no wrong without a remedy, he said;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and was there not a <i>wrong</i> in the case of a poor man
wrongfully deprived of his own? And how could this
be <i>remedied</i>, if the old law of Maintenance stood like a
bugbear in the way of humane and spirited practitioners?
Was no one to be at liberty to take up the cause of the oppressed,
encouraged by the prospect of an ample recompense?
It might be said, perhaps&mdash;let the claimant sue
<i>in formâ pauperis</i>: but then he must swear that he is not
worth five pounds; and a man may not be able to take
that oath, and yet be unequal to the commencement of
a suit requiring the outlay of thousands. Moreover, a
pretty prospect it was for such a suitor, (<i>in formâ pauperis</i>,)
if he should happen to be nonsuited&mdash;to be "put
to his election, whether to be whipped or pay the costs."[<a href='#Note_5'>5</a>]
Thus reasoned within himself that astute person, Mr.
Frankpledge; and at length satisfied himself that he had
framed an instrument which would "meet the case"&mdash;that
"would hold water." To the best of my recollection,
it was a <span class="smcap">bond</span>, conditioned to pay the sum of ten thousand
pounds to Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, within two
months of Titmouse's being put into possession of the rents
and profits of the estate in question. The <i>condition</i> of that
bond was, as its framer believed, drawn in a masterly manner;
and his draft was lying before Messrs. Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap, on the Wednesday morning, (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the day
after Titmouse's interview with them,) and had succeeded
at length in exciting the approbation of Mr. Quirk himself;
when&mdash;whew!&mdash;down came a note from Mr. Frankpledge,
to the effect that, "since preparing the draft bond," he had
"had reason <i>slightly to modify</i> his original opinion," owing
to his "having lit upon a <span class="smcap">late case</span>," in which an instrument
precisely similar to the one which he had prepared
for his admiring clients, had been held "totally ineffectual
and void both at law and in equity." I say, Mr. Frankpledge's
note was to that effect; for so ingeniously had he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
framed it&mdash;so effectually concealed his retreat beneath a
little cloud of contradictory authorities, like as the ink-fish,
they say, eludeth its pursuers&mdash;that his clients cursed the
law, not their draftsman; and, moreover, by prudently
withholding the <i>name</i> of the "late case," he, at all events
for a while, had prevented their observing that it was <i>senior</i>
to some eight or ten cases which (indefatigable man!)
he had culled for them out of the legal garden, and arrayed
on the back of his draft. Slightly disconcerted were
Messrs. Quirk and Gammon, it may be believed, at this
new view of the "result of the authorities." "Mortmain is
always right!" said Quirk, looking hard at Gammon; who
observed simply that one day Frankpledge would be as
old as Mortmain then was&mdash;by which time (thought he)
I also know where&mdash;please God&mdash;<i>you</i> will be, my old
friend, if there's any truth in the Scriptures! In this
pleasant frame of mind were the partners, when the impudent
apparition of Huckaback presented itself, in the
manner which has been described. Huckaback's commentary
upon the disgusting text of Titmouse over-night, (as
a lawyer would say, in analogy to a well-known term,
"Coke upon Littleton,") produced an effect upon their
minds which may be easily imagined. It was while
their minds were under these two soothing influences,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of the insolence of Huckaback and the vacillation
of Frankpledge, that Mr. Gammon had penned the
note to Titmouse, (surely, under the circumstances, one
of extraordinary temper and forbearance,) which had occasioned
him the agonies I have been attempting faintly to
describe;&mdash;and that Quirk, summoning Snap into the
room, had requested him to give orders for denial to Titmouse
if he should again make his appearance at the
office; which injunction Snap forthwith delivered in the
clerk's room, in a tone and manner that were a very
model of the <i>imperative mood</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>A day or two afterwards, Mr. Quirk, (who was a man
that stuck like a limpet to a rock to any point which occurred
to him,) in poring over that page in the fourth
volume of <i>Blackstone's Commentaries</i>, where were to be
found the passages which have been already quoted, (and
which both Quirk and Gammon had long had off by heart,)
as he sat one day at dinner, at home, whither he had taken
the volume in question, fancied he had at last hit upon a
notable crotchet, which, the more he thought of, the more
he was struck with; determining to pay a visit in the
morning to Mr. Mortmain. The spark of light that had
twinkled till it kindled in the tinder of his mind, was
struck by his hard head out of the following sentence of
the text in question:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A man <i>may</i>, however, maintain the suit of his near kinsman,
servant, or <span class="smcap">poor neighbor</span>, out of <i>charity and compassion</i>,
with impunity; <i>otherwise</i>, the punishment is," &amp;c. &amp;c.[<a href='#Note_6'>6</a>]</p></div>

<p>Now, it seemed to Mr. Quirk, that the words which I
have placed in italics and small capitals, met the case of
poor Tittlebat Titmouse exactly. He stuck to that view
of the case, till he <i>almost</i> began to think that he really
had a kind of a sort of a charity and compassion for poor
Tittlebat&mdash;kept out of his rights&mdash;tyrannized over by
a vulgar draper in Oxford Street&mdash;where, too, no doubt,
he was half starved.&mdash;"It's a great blessing that one's
got the means&mdash;and the inclination, to serve one's poor
neighbors"&mdash;thought Quirk, as he swallowed glass after
glass of the <i>wine that maketh glad the heart of man</i>&mdash;and
also <i>softens</i> it;&mdash;for the more he drank, the more and
more pitiful became his mood&mdash;the more sensitive was
he to compassionate suggestions; and by the time that
he had finished the decanter, he was all but in tears!
These virtuous feelings brought their own reward, too&mdash;for,
from time to time, they conjured up, as it were, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
faint rainbow image of a bond conditioned for the payment
of <span class="smcap">Ten Thousand Pounds</span>!</p>

<p>To change the metaphor a little&mdash;by the time that
old Quirk had reached his office in the morning, the
heated iron had cooled. If his heart <i>had</i> retained any
of the maudlin softness of the preceding evening, the following
pathetic letter from Titmouse might have made a
very deep impression upon it, and fixed him, in the benevolent
and disinterested mind of the old lawyer, as
indeed his "poor neighbor." The following is an exact
copy of that lucid and eloquent composition. It had
been written by Mr. Titmouse, all out of his own head;
and with his own hand had he left it at the office, at a
late hour on the preceding evening.</p>

<p>This exquisitely-skilful epistle might indeed have
brought tears into Mr. Quirk's eyes, if he had been <i>used</i>
to the melting mood, which he was not; having never
been seen actually to shed a tear but once&mdash;when five-sixths
of his little bill of costs (£196, 15s. 4d.) were taxed
off in an auction on a Bill of Exchange for £13.[<a href='#Note_7'>7</a>] As it
was, he tweedled the letter about in his hands for about
five minutes, in a musing mood, and then stepped with it
into Mr. Gammon's room. That gentleman took the
letter with an air of curiosity, and read it over; at every
sentence (if indeed a sentence there was in it) bursting
into soft laughter.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" he laughed on concluding it&mdash;"a comical
gentleman, Mr. Titmouse, upon my honor!"</p>

<p>"Funny&mdash;isn't it rather?" interposed Mr. Quirk,
standing with his hands fumbling about in his breeches pockets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a crawling despicable little rascal!&mdash;ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I don't quite say that, either," said Quirk,
doubtingly&mdash;"I&mdash;don't exactly look at it in <i>that</i> light!"</p>

<p>"My dear sir!" exclaimed Gammon, leaning back in
his chair, and laughing rather heartily, (at least for him.)</p>

<p>"You can't leave off that laugh of yours," said Quirk,
a little tartly; "but I must say I don't see anything in
the letter to laugh at so particularly. It is written in
a most respectful manner, and shows a proper feeling
towards the House!"</p>

<p>"Ay! see how he speaks of <i>me</i>!" interrupted Gammon,
with such a smile!&mdash;</p>

<p>"And doesn't he speak so of me? and all of us?"</p>

<p>"He'll let the house tread on him till he can tread
on the house, I dare say."</p>

<p>"But you must own, Mr. Gammon, it shows we've
licked him into shape a bit&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a little vile creeping reptile now, and so it
will be to the end of the chapter&mdash;of our proceedings;
and when we've <i>done</i> everything&mdash;really, Mr. Quirk!
if one <i>were</i> apt to lose one's temper, it would be to
see such a <i>thing</i> as that put into possession of such a fortune."</p>

<p>"That may be, Mr. Gammon; but I
really&mdash;hem!&mdash;trust&mdash;I've&mdash;a
higher feeling!&mdash;To right&mdash;the injured"&mdash;&mdash; He
could get no farther.</p>

<p>"Hem!" exclaimed Gammon.</p>

<p>The partners smiled at one another. A touch, or an
attempted touch at <i>disinterestedness</i>!&mdash;and at Quirk's
time of life!</p>

<p>"But he's now in a humor for <i>training</i>, at all events&mdash;isn't
he?" exclaimed Quirk&mdash;"we've something now
to go to work upon&mdash;gradually."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't that a leaf out of my book, Mr. Quirk?&mdash;isn't
that exactly what"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, well&mdash;what does it signify?" interrupted
Quirk, rather petulantly&mdash;"I've got a crotchet that'll
do for us, yet, about the matter of law, and make all
right and tight&mdash;so I'm going to Mortmain."</p>

<p>"I've got a little idea of my own of that sort, Mr.
Quirk," said Gammon&mdash;"I've got an extract from Co-Litt&mdash;.
I can't imagine how either of them could
have missed it; and, as Frankpledge dines with me to-day,
we shall talk it all over. But, by the way, Mr.
Quirk, I should say, with all deference, that we'll take
no more notice of this fellow till we've got some screw
tight enough"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;all that may be very well; but you see,
Gammon, the fellow seems the real heir, after all&mdash;and
if <i>he</i> don't get it, <i>no one can</i>;
and if <i>he</i> don't&mdash;<i>we</i> don't! eh?"</p>

<p>"There's a very great deal of force in that observation,
Mr. Quirk&mdash;it gives one another view of the subject!"&mdash;said
Gammon, emphatically:&mdash;and, tolerably well pleased
with one another, they parted. If Quirk might be compared
to an old file, Gammon was the <i>oil</i>!&mdash;so they got
on, in the main, very well together. It hardly signifies
what was the result of their interviews with their two
conveyancers. The two partners met the next morning
on ordinary business; and as each made no allusions whatever
to the "crotchet" of the day before, it may be safely
inferred that each had been satisfied by his conveyancer
of having found out a mare's nest.</p>

<p>"I think, by the way," said Mr. Gammon to Mr. Quirk,
before they parted on the previous evening, "it may be
as well, all things considered, to acknowledge the receipt
of the fellow's note&mdash;eh?&mdash;<i>Can't</i> do any harm, you know,
and civility costs nothing&mdash;hem!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"The very thing I was thinking of," replied Quirk, as
he always did, on hearing any suggestion from Mr. Gammon.
So by that night's post was despatched (post-paid)
the following note to Mr. Titmouse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap have the pleasure of acknowledging
the receipt of Mr. Titmouse's polite letter of last
night's date; and earnestly beg that he will not distress himself
about the little incident that occurred at their office on Tuesday
night, and which they assure him they have quite forgotten.
They made all allowances, however their feelings suffered at
the time. They beg Mr. T. will give them credit for not losing
sight of his interests, to the best of their ability; obstructed as
they are, however, by numerous serious difficulties. If they
should be hereafter overcome, he may rest assured of their
promptly communicating with him; and till then they trust
Mr. T. will not inconvenience himself by calling on, or writing
to them.</p>

<p><i>Saffron Hill, 15th July 18&mdash;.</i></p>

<p>"P. S.&mdash;Messrs. Q. G. and S. regret to hear that any unpleasantness
has arisen (Gammon could hardly write for laughing)
between Mr. Titmouse and his friend Mr. Hicklebagle,
who, they assure him, manifested a very warm interest in behalf
of Mr. T., and conducted himself with the greatest propriety
on the occasion of his calling upon Messrs. Q. G. and S.
They happened at that moment to be engaged in matters of
the highest importance; which will, they trust, explain any
appearance of abruptness they might have exhibited towards
that gentleman. Perhaps Mr. Titmouse will be so obliging as
to intimate as much to Mr. Hickerbag."</p></div>

<p>There was an obvious reason for this polite allusion to
Huckaback. Gammon thought it very possible that that
gentleman might be in Mr. Titmouse's confidence, and exercise
a powerful influence over him hereafter; and that
influence Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap might find
it well worth their while to secure beforehand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>The moment that Titmouse, with breathless haste, had
read over this mollifying document, which being directed
to his lodgings correctly, he obtained as soon as he had
got home, after quitting Mr. Tag-rag, about ten o'clock,
he hastened to his friend Huckaback. That gentleman
(who seemed now virtually recognized by Messrs. Quirk,
Gammon, and Snap as Titmouse's confidant) shook his
head ominously, exclaiming&mdash;"Blarny, blarny!" and a
bitter sneer settled on his disagreeable features, till he
had read down to the postscript; the perusal of which
effected a sudden change in his feelings. He declared,
with a great oath, that Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and
Snap were "perfect gentlemen," and would "do the right
thing after all&mdash;Titmouse might depend upon it;" an
assurance which greatly cheered Titmouse, to whose keen
discernment it never once occurred to refer Huckaback's
altered tone to the right cause, viz. the lubricating quality
of the postscript; and since Titmouse did not allude
to it, no more did Mr. Huckaback, although his own
double misnomer stuck not a little in his throat. So
effectual, indeed, had been that most skilful postscript
upon the party at whom it had been aimed, that he exerted
himself unceasingly to revive Titmouse's confidence
in Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap; and so far succeeded,
that Titmouse returned to his lodgings at a late
hour, a somewhat happier, if not a <i>wiser</i> man than he had
left them. By the time, however, that he had got into
bed, having once more spelled over the note in question,
he felt as despondent as ever, and thought that Huckaback
had not known what he had been talking about.
He also adverted to an <i>apparently</i> careless allusion by
Huckaback to the injuries which had been inflicted upon
him by Titmouse on the Wednesday night: and which,
by the way, Huckaback determined it should be no fault
of his if Titmouse easily forgot! He hardly knew why&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
he disliked this particularly.&mdash;Whom had he, however,
in the world, but Huckaback? In company with
him alone, Titmouse felt that his pent-up feelings could
discharge themselves. Huckaback had certainly a wonderful
knack of keeping up Titmouse's spirits, whatever
cause he fancied he might really have for depression. In
short, he longed for the Sunday morning, ushering in a day
of rest and sympathy. Titmouse would indeed then have
to look back upon an agitating and miserable week, what
with the dismal upsetting of his hopes in the manner
I have described, and the tyrannical treatment which
he had experienced at Tag-rag and Co.'s. His tormentor
there, however, began at length, in some degree, to relax
his <i>active</i> exertions against Titmouse, simply because of
the exertion requisite for keeping them up. He attributed
the pallid cheek and depressed manner of Titmouse
entirely to the discipline which had been inflicted upon
him at the shop; and was gratified at perceiving that
all his other young men seemed, especially in his presence,
to have imbibed his hatred of Titmouse. What produced
in Tag-rag this hatred of Titmouse? Simply what
had taken place on the Monday. Mr. Tag-rag's dignity
and power had been doggedly set at nought by one of
his shopmen, who had since refused to make the least
submission, or offer any kind of apology. Such conduct
struck at the root of subordination in his great establishment.
Again, there is perhaps nothing in the world
so calculated to enrage a petty and vulgar mind to the
highest pitch of malignity, as the cool persevering defiance
of an inferior, whom it strives to <i>despise</i>, while it is
only <i>hating</i>, feeling at the same time such to be the case.
Tag-rag now and then, when he looked towards Titmouse,
as he stood behind the counter, felt as though he could
have killed the little ape. Titmouse attempted once or
twice, during the week, to obtain a situation elsewhere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
but in vain. He could expect no character from Tag-rag;
and when the 10th of August should have arrived, what
was to become of him? These were the kind of thoughts
often passing through his mind during the Sunday, which
he and Huckaback spent together in unceasing conversation
on the one absorbing event of the last week. Titmouse,
poor little puppy, had dressed himself with just
as much care as usual; but as he was giving the finishing
touches at his toilet, pumping up grievous sighs every
half minute, the sum of his reflections might be stated in
the miserable significance of a quaint saying of Poor
Richard's&mdash;"How hard is it to make an empty sack stand upright!"</p>

<p>Although the sun shone as vividly and beautifully as on
the preceding Sunday, to Titmouse's saddened eye there
seemed a sort of gloom everywhere. Up and down
the Park he and Huckaback walked, towards the close of
the afternoon; but Titmouse had not so elastic a strut as
before. He felt empty and sinking. Everybody seemed
to know what a sad pretender he was: and the friends
quitted the magic circle much earlier than had been usual
with Titmouse. What with the fatigue of a long day's
saunter, the vexation of having had but a hasty, inferior,
and unrefreshing meal, which did not deserve the name
of dinner, and their unpleasant thoughts, both seemed
depressed as they walked along the streets. At length
they arrived at the open doors of a gloomy-looking building,
into which two or three sad and prim-looking people
were entering. After walking a few paces past the door&mdash;"Do
you know, Huck," said Titmouse, stopping,
"I've often thought that&mdash;that&mdash;there's something
in <i>Religion</i>."</p>

<p>"To be sure there is, for those that like it&mdash;who
doubts it? It's all very well in its place, no doubt,"
replied Huckaback, with much surprise, which increased,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
as he felt himself being slowly swayed round towards the
building in question. "But what of that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing; but&mdash;hem! hem!" replied Titmouse,
sinking his voice to a whisper&mdash;"a touch of&mdash;religion&mdash;eh?&mdash;would
not be so much amiss, just now! I feel&mdash;uncommon
inclined that way, somehow, 'pon my soul!"</p>

<p>"Religion's all very well, Titty, dear!&mdash;for them
that has much to be thankful for; but devil take me!
what have either you or me to be"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"But, Huck&mdash;how do you know but we might <i>get</i>
something to be thankful for, by praying?&mdash;I've often
heard of great things in that line&mdash;but&mdash;<i>do</i> come in
with me, Huck!"</p>

<p>Huckaback stood for a moment irresolute, twirling
about his cane, and looking rather distastefully towards
the dingy building. "It won't answer," said he, faintly.
Titmouse drew him nearer; but he suddenly started
back.&mdash;"No! oh, 'tis only a meeting-house, Tit!
Curse Dissenters, how I hate 'em! Isn't your precious
governor one in that line? Give <i>me</i> a regular-like, respectable
church, with a proper steeple, and parson, and
prayers, and an organ, and all that!"</p>

<p>Titmouse secretly acknowledged the force of these
observations; and the intelligent and piously disposed
couple, with perhaps a just, but certainly a somewhat
sudden regard for orthodoxy, were not long before they
had found their way into a church where evening service
was being performed. They ascended the gallery stair;
and seeing no reason to be ashamed of being at church,
down they both went, with loud clattering steps and a
bold air, into the very central seat (which happened to
be vacant) in the front of the gallery. Titmouse paid a
most exemplary attention to what was going on, kneeling,
sitting, and standing with exact propriety, in the proper
places; joining audibly in the responses, and keeping his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
eyes pretty steadily on the prayer-book, which he found
lying there. He even rebuked Huckaback for whispering
(during one of the most solemn parts of the service) that
"there was an uncommon pretty gal in the next pew!"&mdash;He
thought that the clergyman was a remarkable fine
preacher, and said some things that he <i>must</i> have meant
for him, Titmouse, in particular!</p>

<p>"Curse me, Hucky!" said he, heatedly, as soon as
they had quitted the church, and were fairly in the
street&mdash;"Curse me if&mdash;if&mdash;ever I felt so comfortable-like in
my mind before, as I do now&mdash;see if I don't go again
next Sunday!"</p>

<p>"Lord, Tit, you don't <i>really</i> mean&mdash;eh?&mdash;it's deuced
dull work!"</p>

<p>"Hang me if I don't, though! and if anything should
come of it&mdash;if I <i>do</i> but get the estate&mdash;(I wonder, now,
where <i>Mr. Gammon</i> goes to church. I should like to
know!&mdash;I'd go there regularly)&mdash;But if I <i>do</i> get the
thing&mdash;you see if I don't"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, I don't know; it's not much use praying for
money, Tit; I've tried it myself, once or twice, but it
didn't answer!"</p>

<p>"I'll take my oath you was staring at the gals all
the while, Hucky!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Titty!" exclaimed Huckaback, and winked his
eye, and put the tip of his forefinger to the tip of his
nose, and laughed.</p>

<p>Titmouse continued in what he doubtless imagined to
be a devout frame of mind, for several minutes after quitting
the church. But close by the aforesaid church, the
devil had a thriving little establishment, in the shape of
a cigar-shop; in which a showily-dressed young Jewess
sat behind the counter, right underneath a glaring
gas-light&mdash;with a narrow stripe of greasy black velvet across
her forehead, and long ringlets resting on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
shoulders&mdash;bandying slang with two or three other such creatures
as Titmouse and Huckaback. Our friends entered and
purchased a cigar a-piece, which they lit on the spot; and
after each of them had exchanged an impudent wink with
the Jewess, out they went, puffing away&mdash;all the remains
of their piety! When they had come to the end of their
cigars they parted, each speeding homeward. Titmouse,
on reaching his lodgings, sank into profound depression.
He felt an awful conviction that his visit to the cigar-shop
had entirely spoiled the effect of his previous attendance
at the church; and that, if so disposed, (and it served him
right,) he might now sit and whistle for his ten thousand
a-year. Thoughts such as these drove him nearly distracted.
If, indeed, he had foreseen having to go through
such another week as the one just over, I think it not impossible
that before the arrival of the ensuing Sunday, he
might have afforded a little employment to that ancient
and gloomy functionary, a coroner, and his jury. At that
time, however, inquests of this sort were matter-of-fact and
melancholy affairs enough; which I doubt not would have
been rather a <i>dissuasive</i> from suicide, in the estimation of
one who might be supposed ambitious of the <i>éclat</i> of a
modern inquest; where, indeed, such strange antics are
played by certain new performers as would suffice to revive
the corpse, (if it were a corpse that had ever had a
spark of sense or spirit in it,) and make it kick the coroner
out of the room.[<a href='#Note_8'>8</a>] But to one of so high an ambition
as Tittlebat Titmouse, how delightful would it not have
been, to anticipate becoming (what had been quite impracticable
during life) the object of public attention after
his death&mdash;by means of a flaming dissertation by the coroner
on his own zeal and spirit&mdash;the nature and extent
of his rights, powers, and duties;&mdash;when high doctors are
brow-beaten, the laws set at defiance, and public decency
plucked by the beard, and the torn and bleeding hearts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
surviving relatives still further agonized by an exposure,
all quivering under the recent stroke, to the gaping vulgar!
Indeed, I sometimes think that the object of certain
coroners, now-a-days, is twofold; first, public&mdash;to
disgust people with suicide, by showing what horrid proceedings
will take place over their carcasses; and secondly,
private&mdash;to get the means of studying anatomy by <i>post
mortems</i>, which the said coroner never could procure in his
own practice; which enables us to account for some things
one has lately seen, viz. that if a man come to his death
by means of a wagon crushing his legs, the coroner institutes
an exact examination of the structure of the <i>lungs</i>
and <i>heart</i>. I take it to be getting now into a rule&mdash;the
propriety whereof, some people think, cannot be doubted&mdash;namely,
that bodies ought now to be opened only to
prove that they ought not to have been opened; an inquest
must be held, in order to demonstrate that it need
not have been held, except that certain fees thereby find
their way into the pocket of the aforesaid coroner, which
would otherwise not have done so. In short, such a coroner
as I have in my eye may be compared to a great ape
squatting on a corpse, furiously chattering and spitting at
all around it; and I am glad that it hath at last had wit
enough first to <i>shut the door</i> before proceeding to its horrid tricks.</p>

<p>Touching, by the way, the <i>moral</i> of suicide, it is a way
which some have of <i>cutting</i> the Gordian knot of the difficulties
of life; which having been done, possibly the very
first thing made manifest to the spirit, after taking its
mad leap into the dark may be&mdash;how very easily the
said knot might have been <span class="smcap">untied</span>; nay, that it was <i>on
the very point</i> of being untied, if the impatient spirit
had stayed only a moment longer!</p>

<p>I said it was not <i>impossible</i> that Mr. Titmouse might,
under the circumstances alluded to, have done the deed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
which has called forth the above natural and profound
reflections; but, upon the whole, it is hardly <i>probable</i>;
for he knew that by doing so he would (first) irreparably
injure society, by depriving it of an enlightened and invaluable
member; (secondly,) inflict great indignity on
his precious body, of which, during life, he had always
taken the most affectionate care, by consigning it to
burial in a cross-road, at night-time, with a stake run
through it,[<a href='#Note_9'>9</a>] and moreover peril the little soul that had
just leaped out of it, by not having any burial-service said
over his aforesaid remains; and (lastly) lose all chance of
enjoying Ten Thousand a-Year&mdash;at least upon the earth.
I own I was a little startled (as I dare say was the pensive
reader) at a passage of mournful significance in Mr.
Titmouse's last letter to Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and
Snap, viz.&mdash;"How full of trouble I am, <i>often thinking
of death</i>, which is the end of everything;" but on carefully
considering the context, I am disposed to think that
the whole was only an astute device of Titmouse's, either
to rouse the fears, or stimulate the feelings, or excite the
hopes of the three arbiters of his destiny to whom it was
addressed. Mr. Gammon, he thought, might be thereby
moved to pity; while Mr. Quirk would probably be operated
upon by fears, lest the sad contingency pointed at
might deprive the house of one who would richly repay
their exertions; and by hopes of indefinite advantage, if
they could by any means prevent its happening. That
these gentlemen really <i>did</i> keenly scrutinize, and carefully
weigh every expression in that letter, ridiculous as
it was, and contemptible as, I fear, it showed its writer
to be, is certain; but it did not occur to them to compare
with it the spirit, at least, and intention of their own
answer to it. Did the latter document contain less cunning
and insincerity, because it was couched in somewhat
superior phraseology? They could conceal their selfish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and over-reaching designs, while poor Titmouse exposed
all his little mean-mindedness and hypocrisy, simply because
he had not learned how to conceal it effectually.
'Twas indeed a battle for the very same object, but between
unequal combatants. Each was trying to <i>take in</i>
the other. If Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap despised
and loathed the man to whom they exhibited such anxious
courtesy, Titmouse hated and feared those whom his
interests compelled him for a while to conciliate. Was
there, in fact, a pin to choose between them&mdash;except perhaps
that Titmouse was, in a manner, excused by his
necessities? But, in the mean while&mdash;to proceed&mdash;his
circumstances were becoming utterly desperate. He continued
to endure great suffering at Mr. Tag-rag's during
the day&mdash;the constant butt of the ridicule and insult of
his amiable companions, and the victim of his employer's
vile and vulgar spirit of hatred and oppression. His spirit,
(such as it was,) in short, was very nearly broken. Though
he seized every opportunity that offered, to inquire for another
situation, he was unsuccessful; for all whom he applied
to, spoke of the <i>strict character</i> they should require,
"before taking a new hand into their establishment." His
occupation at nights, after quitting the shop, was twofold
only&mdash;either to call upon Huckaback, (whose sympathy,
however, he was exhausting rapidly,) or solace his feelings
by walking down to Saffron Hill, and lingering about
the closed office of Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap&mdash;there
was a kind of gratification even in that! He once
or twice felt flustered even on catching a glimpse of the
old housekeeper returning home with a pint of porter in
her hand. How he would have rejoiced to get into her
good graces, and accompany her into even the kitchen&mdash;when
he would be on the premises, at least, and conversing
with one of the establishment, of those who he believed
could, with a stroke of their pens, turn this wilderness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
a world into a paradise for him! But he dared not make
any overtures in that quarter, for fear of their getting to the
notice of the dreaded Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap.</p>

<p>At length, no more than three or four shillings stood
between him and utter destitution; and the only person
in the world to whom he could apply for even the most
trivial assistance, was Huckaback&mdash;whom, however, he
knew to be really little better off than himself; and whom,
moreover, he felt to be treating him more and more coldly,
as the week wore on, without his hearing of any the least
tidings from Saffron Hill. Huckaback evidently felt now
scarcely any interest or pleasure in the visits of his melancholy
friend, and was plainly disinclined to talk about
his affairs. At length he quite turned up his nose with
disgust, whenever Titmouse took out the well-worn note
of Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, (which was almost
dropping in pieces with being constantly carried about in
his pocket, taken in and out, and folded and unfolded,)
for the purpose of conning over its contents, as if there
might yet linger in it some hitherto undiscovered source
of consolation. Poor Titmouse, therefore, looked at it on
every such occasion with as eager and vivid an interest
as ever; but it was glanced at by Huckaback with a half-averted
eye, and a cold drawling, yawning "Ya&mdash;a&mdash;as&mdash;I
see&mdash;I&mdash;dare&mdash;say!" While his impressions
of Titmouse's bright prospects were thus being rapidly
effaced, his smarting recollections of the drubbing he had
received became more distinct and frequent, his feelings
of resentment more lively, nor the less so, because the
expression of them had been stifled, (while he had considered
the star of Titmouse to be in the ascendant,) till
the time for setting them into motion and action, had
gone by. In fact, the presence of Titmouse, suggesting
such thoughts and recollections, became intolerable to
Huckaback; and Titmouse's perceptions (dull as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
naturally were, but a little quickened by recent suffering)
gave him more and more distinct notice of this circumstance,
at the precise time when he meditated applying
for the loan of a few shillings. These feelings made him
as humble towards Huckaback, and as tolerant of his increasing
rudeness and ill-humor, as he felt abject towards
Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap; for, unless he could
succeed in wringing some trifling loan from Huckaback,
(if he really had it in his power to advance him <i>anything</i>,)
Titmouse really could not conjecture what was to become
of him. Various faint but unadroit hints and feelers of
his had been thrown away upon Huckaback, who did not,
or would not, comprehend them. At length, however, a
sudden and fearful pressure compelled poor Titmouse to
speak out. Gripe, the collector, called one morning for
the poor's rates due from Mrs. Squallop, and drained her
of almost every penny of ready money which she had by
her. This threw the good woman upon her resources to
replenish her empty pocket&mdash;and down she came upon
Titmouse&mdash;or rather, up she went to him; for his heart
sank within him, one night on his return from the shop,
having only just taken off his hat and lit his candle, as he
heard the fat old termagant's well-known heavy step ascending
the stairs, and approaching nearer and nearer to
his door. Her loud imperative single knock vibrated
through his very heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Squallop! How d'ye do, Mrs. Squallop?"
commenced Titmouse, faintly, when he had opened the
door; "Won't you take a chair?" with trepidation offering
to the panting dame almost the only chair he had.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I a'n't come to stay, Mr. Titmouse, because,
d'ye see, in coorse you've got a pound, <i>at least</i>, ready for
me, as you promised long ago&mdash;and never more welcome;
there's old Gripe been here to-day, and had his hodious
rates&mdash;(drat the poor, say I! them as can't work should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
starve!&mdash;rates is a robbery!)&mdash;but howsomdever he's
cleaned <i>me</i> out to-day; so, in coorse, I come up to <i>you</i>.
Got it, Mr. Titmouse?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;'pon my life, Mrs. Squallop, I'm uncommon sorry"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, bother your sorrow, Mr. Titmouse!&mdash;out with
the needful, for I can't stop palavering here."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can't, so help me&mdash;&mdash;!" gasped Titmouse, with
the calmness of desperation.</p>

<p>"You can't! And marry, sir, why not, may I make
bold to ask?" inquired Mrs. Squallop, after a moment's
pause, striving to choke down her rage.</p>

<p>"P'r'aps you can get blood out of a stone, Mrs. Squallop;
it's what <i>I</i> can't," replied Titmouse, striving to screw his
courage up to the sticking place, to encounter one who
was plainly bent upon mischief. "I've got two shillings&mdash;there
they are," throwing them on the table; "and
cuss me if I've another rap in the world; there, ma'am!
take 'em, do; and drive me desperate!"</p>

<p>"You're a liar, then, that's flat!" exclaimed Mrs.
Squallop, slapping her hand upon the table, with a violence
that made the candle quiver on it, and almost fall
down. "<i>You</i> have the <i>himperance</i>," said she, sticking
her arms akimbo, and commencing the address she had
been preparing in her own mind ever since Mr. Gripe had
quitted her house, "to stand there and tell me you've
got nothing in the world but them <i>two shillings</i>! Heugh!
Out on you, you oudacious fellow!&mdash;you jack-a-dandy!
<i>You</i> tell me you haven't got more than them two shillings,
and yet turns out every Sunday morning of your life like
a lord, with your pins, and your rings, and your chains,
and your fine coat, and your gloves, and your spurs, and
your dandy cane&mdash;ough! you whipper-snapper! You're
a cheat&mdash;you're a swindler, jack-a-dandy! You're the
contempt of the whole court, you are&mdash;you jack-a-dandy!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
You've got all my rent on your back, and so you've had
every Sunday for three months, you cheat!&mdash;you low
fellow!&mdash;you ungrateful chap! You're a-robbing the
widow and fatherless! Look at me, and my six fatherless
children down there, you good-for-nothing, nasty, proud
puppy!&mdash;eugh! it makes me sick to see you. <i>You</i> dress
yourself out like my lord mayor! You've bought a gold
chain with my rent, you rascally cheat! <i>You</i> dress yourself
out?&mdash;Ha, ha!&mdash;you're a nasty, mean-looking,
humpty-dumpty, carroty-headed"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You'd better not say <i>that</i> again, Mrs. Squallop," quoth
Titmouse, with a fierce glance.</p>

<p>"Not say it again!&mdash;ha, ha! Hoighty-toighty, carroty-haired
jack-a-dandy!&mdash;Why, you hop-o-my-thumb! d'ye
think I won't say whatever I choose, and in my own house,
and to a man that can't pay his rent? You're a Titmouse
by name and by nature; there a'n't a cockroach crawling
in our kitchen that a'n't more harmless than you!&mdash;You're
a himperant cheat, and dandy, and knave, and a
liar, and a red-haired rascal&mdash;and <i>that</i> in your teeth!
(snapping her fingers.) Ough! Your name stinks in the
court. You're a-taking of everybody in as will trust you
to a penny's amount. There's poor old Cox, the tailor,
with a sick wife and children, whom you've cheated this
many months, all of his not having sperrit to summons
you! But <i>I'll</i> set him upon you; you see if I don't&mdash;and
I'll have my own, too, or I wouldn't give <i>that</i> for the
laws!" shouted Mrs. Squallop, again furiously snapping
her fingers in his face; and then pausing for breath after
her eloquent invective.</p>

<p>"Now, what <i>is</i> the use," said Titmouse, gently, being
completely cowed&mdash;"now, what good <i>can</i> it do to go on
in this way, Mrs. Squallop?"</p>

<p>"Missus me no missus, Mr. Titmouse, but pay me my
rent, you jack-a-dandy! You've got my rent on your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
back, and on your little finger; and I'll have it off you
before I've done with you, I warrant you. I'm your
landlady, and I'll sell you up; I'll have old Thumbscrew
here the first thing in the morning, and distrain everything,
and you, too, you jackdaw, if any one would buy
you, which they won't! I'll have my rent at last: I've
been too easy with you, you ungrateful chap; for, mark,
even Gripe this morning says, 'Haven't you a gentleman
lodger up above? get him to pay you your own,' says he;
and so I will. I'm sick of all this, and I'll have my
rights! Here's my son, Jem, a far better-looking chap
than you, though he <i>hasn't</i> got hair like a sandy mop all
under his chin, and he's obligated for to work from one
week's end to another, in a paper cap and fustian jacket;
and you&mdash;you painted jackanapes! But now I have got
you, and I'll turn you inside out, though I know there's
nothing in you! But I'll try to get at your fine coats,
and spurs, and trousers, your chains and pins, and make
something of them before I've done with you, you jack-a-dandy!"&mdash;and
the virago shook her fist at him, looking
as though she had not yet uttered even half that was
in her heart towards him.</p>

<p>[Alas, alas, unhappy Titmouse, much-enduring son of
sorrow! I perceive that you now feel the sharpness of an
angry female tongue; and indeed to me, not in the least
approving of the many coarse and heart-splitting expressions
which she uses, it seems, nevertheless, that she hath
not gone exceeding far off the mark in much that she
hath said; for, in truth, in your conduct there is not a
little that to me, piteously inclined towards you as I am,
yet appeareth obnoxious to the edge of this woman's
reproaches. But think not, O bewildered and
not-with-sufficient-distinctness-discerning-the-nature-of-things
Titmouse! that she hath only a sharp and bitter tongue.
In this woman behold a mother, and it may be that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
will soften before you, who have plainly, as I hear, neither
father nor mother. Oh me!]</p>

<p>Poor Titmouse trembled violently; his lips quivered;
and the long pent-up tears forced their way at length over
his eyelids, and fell fast down his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Ah, you may well cry!&mdash;you may! But it's too
late!&mdash;it's my turn to cry now! Don't you think that
I feel for my own flesh and blood, which is my six children?
And isn't what's mine theirs? And aren't you
keeping the fatherless out of their own? It's too bad of
you&mdash;it is! and you know it is," continued Mrs. Squallop, vehemently.</p>

<p>"<i>They've</i> got a mother&mdash;a kind&mdash;good&mdash;mother&mdash;to
take&mdash;care of them," sobbed Titmouse; "but there's
been no one in the&mdash;the&mdash;world that cares a straw for
<i>me</i>&mdash;this twenty&mdash;years!" He fairly wept aloud.</p>

<p>"Well, then, more's the pity for <i>you</i>. If you had,
they wouldn't have let you make such a puppy of
yourself&mdash;and at your landlady's expense, too. You know
you're a fool," said Mrs. Squallop, dropping her voice a
little; for she was a <span class="smcap">mother</span>, after all, and she knew that
what poor Titmouse had just stated was quite true. She
tried hard to feed the fire of her wrath, by forcing into
her thoughts every aggravating topic against Titmouse
that she could think of; but it became every moment
harder and harder to do so, for she was consciously softening
rapidly towards the weeping and miserable little
object, on whom she had been heaping such violent and
bitter abuse. He was a great fool, to be sure&mdash;he was
very fond of fine clothes&mdash;- he knew no better&mdash;he had,
however, paid his rent well enough till lately&mdash;he was a
very quiet, well-disposed lodger, for all <i>she</i> had known&mdash;he
had given her youngest, child a pear not long ago.
Really, thought Mrs. Squallop, I may have gone a <i>leetle</i> too far.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come&mdash;it a'n't no use crying in this way," she
began in an altered tone. "It won't put money into
your pocket, nor my rent into mine. You know you've
wronged me, and I <i>must</i> be paid," she added, but in a
still lower tone. She tried to cough away a certain rising
disagreeable sensation about her throat; for Titmouse,
having turned his back to hide the extent of his
emotions, seemed half-choked with suppressed sobs.</p>

<p>"So you won't speak a word&mdash;not a word&mdash;to the
woman you've injured so much?" inquired Mrs. Squallop,
trying to assume a harsh tone; but her eyes were
a little obstructed with tears.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;<i>can't</i> speak," sobbed Titmouse&mdash;"I&mdash;I feel
ready to drop into a cold early grave!&mdash;everybody hates
me"&mdash;here he paused; and for some moments neither
of them spoke. "I've been kept on my legs the whole
day about the town by Mr. Tag-rag, and had no dinner.
I&mdash;I&mdash;wish I was <i>dead</i>! I do!&mdash;you may take all
I have&mdash;here it is," continued Titmouse, with his foot
pushing towards Mrs. Squallop the old hair trunk that
contained all his little finery. "I sha'n't want them
much longer, for I'm turned out of my situation."</p>

<p>This was too much for Mrs. Squallop, and she was
obliged to wipe her full eyes with the corner of her apron,
without saying a word. Her heart smote her for the misery
she had inflicted on one who seemed quite broken
down. Pity suddenly flew, fluttering his wings&mdash;soft
dove!&mdash;into her heart, and put to flight in an instant
all her enraged feelings. "Come, Mr. Titmouse," said
she, in quite an altered tone, "never mind <i>me</i>; I'm a
plain-spoken woman enough, I dare say&mdash;and often say
more than I mean&mdash;for I know I a'n't over particular
when my blood's up&mdash;but&mdash;lord!&mdash;I&mdash;I wouldn't
hurt a hair of your head, poor chap!&mdash;for all I've said&mdash;no,
not for double the rent you owe me. Come! don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
go on so, Mr. Titmouse&mdash;what's the use?&mdash;it's all
quite&mdash;over&mdash;I'm <i>so</i> sorry&mdash;Lud! if I had <i>really</i>
thought"&mdash;she almost sobbed&mdash;"you'd been so&mdash;so&mdash;why,
I'd have waited till to-morrow night before I'd
said a word. But, Mr. Titmouse, since you haven't had
any dinner, won't you have a mouthful of something&mdash;a
bit of bread and cheese I&mdash;I'll soon fetch you up a bit, and
a drop of beer&mdash;we've just had it in for our suppers."</p>

<p>"No, thank you&mdash;I can't&mdash;I can't eat!" sobbed Titmouse.</p>

<p>"Oh, bother it, but you <i>shall</i>! I'll go down and fetch
it up in half a minute, as sure as my name's Squallop!"
And out of the room and down-stairs she bustled, glad of
a moment to recover herself.</p>

<p>"Lord-a-mercy!" said she, on entering her room, to
her eldest daughter and a neighbor who had just come
in to supper&mdash;and while she hastily cut a thick hunch
of bread, and a good slice of cheese&mdash;"there I've been
a-rating that poor little chap, up at the top room, (my
dandy lodger, you know,) like anything&mdash;and I really
don't think he's had a morsel of victuals in his belly this
precious day; and I've made him cry, poor soul! as if
his heart would break. Pour us out half a pint of that
beer, Sally&mdash;a <i>good</i> half pint, mind!&mdash;I'm going to
take it up-stairs directly. I've gone a deal too far with
him, I do think; but it's all of that nasty old Gripe; I've
been wrong all the day through it! How I hate the
sight of old Gripe! What <i>hodious</i> looking people they
do get to collect the rates and taxes, to be sure!&mdash;Poor
chap," she continued, as she wiped out a plate with her
apron, and put into it the bread and cheese, together
with a knife&mdash;"he offered me a chair when I went in,
so uncommon civil-like, it took a good while before I
could get myself into the humor to <i>give it</i> him as I
wanted. And he's no father nor mother, (half of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
has happened to <i>you</i>, Sal, and the rest will happen one of
these days, you know&mdash;so you mind me while you have
me!) and he's not such a very bad lodger, after all, though
he <i>does</i> get a little behind-hand now and then, and though
he turns out every Sunday like a lord, poor fool&mdash;as
your poor dear father used to say, 'with a shining back
and empty belly.'"</p>

<p>"But that's no reason why honest people should be
kept out of their own, to feed his pride," interposed her
neighbor, a skinny old widow, who had never had chick
nor child, and was always behind-hand with her own
rent; but whose effects were not worth distraining upon.
"I'd get hold of some of his fine crincum-crancums
and gimcracks, for security like, if I was you. I would,
indeed."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;no, poor soul&mdash;I don't hardly like: he's a
vain creature, and puts everything he can on his back, to
be sure; but he a'n't quite a <i>rogue</i>, neither."</p>

<p>"Ah, ha, Mrs. Squallop&mdash;you're such a simple soul!&mdash;Won't
my fine gentleman make off with his finery
after to-night?"</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't have thought it! To be sure he
may! Really, there <i>can't</i> be much harm in asking him
(in a proper kind of way) to deposit one of his fine things
with me, by way of security&mdash;that ring of his, you know&mdash;eh?&mdash;Well,
I'll <i>try</i> it anyhow," said Mrs. Squallop,
as she set off up-stairs.</p>

<p>"I know what <i>I</i> should do, if so be he was a lodger of
<i>mine</i>, that's all," said her visitor, significantly, (as Mrs.
Squallop quitted the room,) vexed to find her supper so
considerably and unexpectedly diminished, especially as
to the pot of porter, which she strongly suspected would
not be replenished.</p>

<p>"There," said Mrs. Squallop, setting down on the table
what she had brought for Titmouse, "there's a bit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
supper for you; and you're welcome to it, I'm sure, Mr. Titmouse."</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you&mdash;I can't eat," said he, casting,
however, upon the victuals a hungry eye, which belied
what he said, while in his heart he longed to be left
alone with them for about three minutes.</p>

<p>"Come, don't be ashamed&mdash;fall to work&mdash;it's good
wholesome victuals," said she, lifting the table near to
the edge of the bed, on the side of which he was sitting,
and taking up the two shillings lying on the table&mdash;"and
capital good beer, I warrant me; you'll sleep like
a top after it."</p>

<p>"You're uncommon kind, Mrs. Squallop; but I sha'n't
get a wink of sleep to-night for thinking"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, bother your thinking! Let me begin to see you
eat a bit. Well, I suppose you don't like to eat and
drink before me, so I'll go." [Here arose a sudden conflict
in the good woman's mind, whether or not she would
act on the suggestion which had been put into her head
down-stairs. She was on the point of yielding to the impulse
of her own good-natured, though coarse feelings; but
at last&mdash;] "I&mdash;I&mdash;dare say, Mr. Titmouse, you mean
what's right and straightforward," she stammered.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Squallop&mdash;you may keep those two shillings;
they're the last farthing I have left in the whole world."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;hem!&mdash;hem!&mdash;ahem! I was just suddenly
a-thinking&mdash;now can't you guess, Mr. Titmouse?"</p>

<p>"What, Mrs. Squallop?" inquired Titmouse, meekly but anxiously.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;suppose now&mdash;if it were only to raise ten
shillings with old Balls, round the corner, on one of those
fine things of yours&mdash;your ring, say!" [Titmouse's
heart sank within him.] "Well, well&mdash;never mind&mdash;don't
fear," said Mrs. Squallop, observing him suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
turn pale again. "I&mdash;I only thought&mdash;but never
mind! it don't signify&mdash;good-night! we can talk about
that to-morrow&mdash;good-night&mdash;a good night's rest to
you, Mr. Titmouse!" and the next moment he heard
her heavy step descending the stairs. Some little time
elapsed before he could recover from the agitation into
which he had been thrown by her last proposal; but
within five minutes of her quitting the room, there stood
before him, on the table, an <i>empty</i> plate and jug.</p>

<hr class='chapter' />

<p>"The beast! the fat old toad!" thought he, the instant
that he had finished masticating what had been supplied
to him by real charity and good-nature&mdash;"the vulgar
wretch!&mdash;the nasty canting old hypocrite!&mdash;I saw what
she was driving at all the while!&mdash;she had her eye on
my ring!&mdash;She'd have me pawn it at old Balls's&mdash;ha,
ha!&mdash;Catch me! that's all!&mdash;Seven shillings a-week
for this nasty hole!&mdash;I'll be bound I pay nearly half the
rent of the whole house&mdash;the old cormorant!&mdash;out of
what she gets from me! How I hate her! More than
half my salary goes into her greasy pocket! Cuss me if
I couldn't have kicked her down-stairs&mdash;porter, bread
and cheese, and all&mdash;while she was standing canting
there!&mdash;A snivelling old beldam!&mdash;Pawn my ring!!&mdash;Lord!!"&mdash;Here
he began to undress. "Ha! I'm up to
her; she'll be coming here to-morrow, with that devil
Thumbscrew, to distrain, I'll be sworn. Well&mdash;I'll take
care of <i>these</i> anyhow;" and, kneeling down and unlocking
his trunk, he took out of it his guard-chain, breast-pin,
studs, and ring, carefully folded them up in paper, and
depositing them in his trousers' pockets, resolved that
henceforth their nightly resting-place should be&mdash;under
his pillow; while during the day they should accompany
his person whithersoever he went. Next he bethought
himself of the two or three important papers to which
Mr. Gammon had referred; and, with tremulous eagerness,
read them over once or twice, but without being able
to extract from them the slightest clew to their real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
character and bearing. Then he folded them up in a half
sheet of writing-paper, which he proceeded to stitch carefully
beneath the lining of his waistcoat; after which he
blew out his slim candle, and with a heavy sigh got into
bed. For some moments after he had blown out the
candle did the image of it remain on his aching and excited
retina; and just so long did the thoughts of <i>ten
thousand a-year</i> dwell on his fancy, fading, however, quickly
away amid the thickening gloom of doubts, and fears, and
miseries, which oppressed him. There he lies, stretched
on his bed, a wretched figure, lying on his breast, his head
buried beneath his feverish arms. Anon, he turns round
upon his back, stretches his wearied limbs to their uttermost,
folds his arms on his breast, then buries them beneath
the pillow, under his head. Now he turns on his
right side, then on his left&mdash;presently he starts up, and
with muttered curse shakes his little pillow, flinging it
down angrily. He cannot sleep&mdash;he cannot rest&mdash;he
cannot keep still. Bursting with irritability, he gets out
of bed, and steps to the window, which opening wide, a
slight gush of fresh air cools his hot face for a moment
or two. His wearied eye looks upward and beholds the
moon shining overhead in cold splendor, turning the
clouds to gold as they flit past her, and shedding a softened
lustre upon the tiled roofs and irregular chimney-pots&mdash;the
only objects visible to him. No sound is
heard, but occasionally the dismal cry of disappointed cat,
the querulous voice of the watchman, and the echo of the
rumbling hubbub of Oxford Street. O miserable Titmouse!
of what avail is it for thee thus to fix thy sorrowful
lack-lustre eye upon the cold Queen of Night!</p>

<hr />

<p>At that moment there happened to be also gazing at
the same glorious object, but at some two hundred miles'
distance from London, a very different person, with very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
different feelings, and in very different circumstances. It
was one of the angels of the earth&mdash;a pure-hearted and
very beautiful girl; who, after a day of peaceful, innocent,
and charitable employment, and having just quitted the
piano, where her exquisite strains had soothed and delighted
the feelings of her brother, harassed with political
anxieties, had retired to her chamber for the night.
A few moments before she was presented to the reader,
she had extinguished her taper, and dismissed her maid
without her having discharged more than half her accustomed
duties&mdash;telling her that she should finish undressing
by the light of the moon, which then poured her soft
radiance into every corner of the spacious but old-fashioned
chamber. Then she drew her chair to the window-recess,
and pushing open the window, sat before it, only partially
undressed as she was, her hair dishevelled, her head leaning
on her hand, gazing upon the scenery before her with
tranquil admiration. Silence reigned absolutely. Not a
sound issued from the ancient groves, which spread far
and wide on all sides of the fine old mansion in which
she dwelt&mdash;solemn solitudes, nor yet less soothing than
solemn! Was not the solitude enhanced by a glimpse
she caught of a restless fawn, glancing in the distance
across the avenue, as he silently changed the tree under
which he slept?&mdash;Then the gentle breeze would enter
her window, laden with sweet scents of which he had just
been rifling the coy flowers beneath, in their dewy repose,
tended and petted during the day by her own delicate
hand!&mdash;Beautiful moon!&mdash;cold and chaste in thy skyey
palace, studded with brilliant and innumerable gems,
and shedding down thy rich and tender radiance upon
this lovely seclusion&mdash;was there upon the whole earth
a more exquisite countenance then turned towards thee
than hers?&mdash;Wrap thy white robe, dearest Kate, closer
round thy fair bosom, lest the amorous night-breeze do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
thee hurt, for he groweth giddy with the sight of thy
charms! Thy rich tresses, half-uncurled, are growing
damp&mdash;- so it is time that thy blue eyes should seek repose.
Hie thee, then, my love!&mdash;to yon antique couch,
with its quaint carvings and satin draperies dimly visible
in the dusky shade, inviting thee to sleep: and having
first bent in cheerful reverence before thy Maker&mdash;to
bed!&mdash;to bed!&mdash;sweet Kate, nothing disturbing thy
serene slumbers, or agitating that beautiful bosom.&mdash;Hush!
hush!&mdash;now she sleeps! It is well that thine
eyes are closed in sleep; for <span class="smcap">behold</span>&mdash;see!&mdash;the brightness
without is disappearing; sadness and gloom are settling
on the face of nature; the tranquil night is changing
her aspect; clouds are gathering, winds are moaning; the
moon is gone:&mdash;but sleep on, sweet Kate&mdash;sleep on,
dreaming not of dark days before thee&mdash;Oh, that thou
couldst sleep on till the brightness returned!</p>

<hr />

<p>After having stood thus leaning against the window for
nearly half an hour, Titmouse, heavily sighing, returned
to bed&mdash;but there he tossed about in wretched restlessness
till nearly four o'clock in the morning. If he now
and then sank into forgetfulness for a while, it was only
to be harassed by the dreadful image of Mrs. Squallop,
shouting at him, tearing his hair, cuffing him, flinging a
pot of porter in his face, opening his boxes, tossing his
clothes about, taking out his invaluable ornaments; by
Tag-rag kicking him out of the shop; and Messrs. Quirk,
Gammon, and Snap dashing past him in a fine carriage,
with six horses, and paying no attention to him as he ran
shouting and breathless after him; Huckaback following,
kicking and pinching him behind. These were the few
little bits of different colored glass in a mental kaleidoscope,
which, turned capriciously round, produced those
innumerable fantastic combinations out of the simple and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
ordinary events of the day, which we call <i>dreams</i>&mdash;tricks
of the wild sisters Fancy, when sober Reason has left her
seat for a while. But this is fitter for the Royal Society
than the bedroom of Tittlebat Titmouse; and I beg the
reader's pardon.</p>

<p>About six o'clock, Titmouse rose and dressed himself;
and, slipping noiselessly and swiftly down-stairs, and out
of the court, in order to avoid all possibility of encountering
his landlady or his tailor, soon found himself in Oxford
Street. Not many people were stirring there. One
or two men who passed him were smoking their morning's
pipe, with a half-awakened air, as if they had only
just got out of a snug bed, in which they always slept
every moment that they lay upon it. Titmouse almost
envied them! What a squalid figure he looked, as he
paced up and down, till at length he saw the porter of
Messrs. Tag-rag &amp; Co. opening the shop-door. He soon
entered it, and commenced another jocund day in that
delightful establishment. The amiable Mr. Tag-rag continued unaltered.</p>

<p>"You're at liberty to take yourself off, sir, this very
day&mdash;this moment, sir; and a good riddance," said he,
bitterly, during the course of the day, after demanding of
Titmouse how he dared to give himself such sullen airs;
"and then we shall see how charming easy it is for gents
like you to get another sitiwation, sir! Your looks and
manner is quite a recommendation, sir! If I was you,
sir, I'd raise my terms! You're worth double what I
give, sir!" Titmouse made no reply. "What do you
mean, sir, by not answering me&mdash;eh, sir?" suddenly
demanded Mr. Tag-rag, with a look of fury.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you'd have me say, sir. What
am I to say, sir?" inquired Titmouse, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"What, indeed! I should like to catch you! Say,
indeed! Only say a word&mdash;and out you go, neck and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
crop. Attend to that old lady coming in, sir. And
mind, sir, I've got my eye on you!" Titmouse did as
he was bid; and Tag-rag, a bland smile suddenly beaming
on his attractive features, hurried down towards the
door, to receive some lady-customers, whom he observed
alighting from a carriage; and at that moment you
would have sworn that he was one of the kindest-hearted
sweetest-tempered men in the world.</p>

<p>When at length <i>this</i> day had come to a close, Titmouse,
instead of repairing to his lodgings, set off, with a
heavy heart, to pay a visit to his excellent friend Huckaback,
whom he knew to have received his quarter's salary
the day before, and from whom he faintly hoped to succeed
in extorting some trifling loan. "If you want to
learn the value of money, <i>try to borrow some</i>," says Poor
Richard&mdash;and Titmouse was now going to learn that
useful but bitter lesson. Oh, how disheartening was Mr.
Huckaback's reception of him! That gentleman, in answering
the modest knock of Titmouse, suspecting who
was his visitor, opened the door but a little way, and in
that little way, with his hand on the latch, he stood, with
a plainly repulsive look.</p>

<p>"Oh! it's you, Titmouse, is it?" he commenced coldly.</p>

<p>"Yes. I&mdash;I just want to speak a word to you&mdash;only
a word or two, Hucky, if you aren't busy?"</p>

<p>"Why, I was just going to go&mdash;but what d'ye want,
Titmouse?" he inquired in a freezing manner, not stirring
from where he stood.</p>

<p>"<i>Let</i> me come inside a minute," implored Titmouse,
feeling as if his little heart were really dropping out of
him: and, in a most ungracious manner, Huckaback
motioned him in.</p>

<p>"Well," commenced Huckaback, with a chilling distrustful look.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Huck, I know you're a good-natured chap&mdash;you
<i>couldn't</i>, just for a short time, lend me ten shill"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, curse me if I can: and that's flat!" briskly
interrupted Huckaback, finding his worst suspicions confirmed.</p>

<p>"Why, Hucky, wasn't you only yesterday paid your salary?"</p>

<p>"Well!&mdash;suppose I was?&mdash;what then? You're a
monstrous cool hand, Titmouse! I never!! So I'm to
lend to you, when I'm starving myself! I've received
such a lot, too, haven't I?"</p>

<p>"I thought we'd always been friends, Hucky," said
Titmouse, faintly; "and so we shouldn't mind helping
one another a bit! Don't you remember, I once lent
you half-a-crown?"</p>

<p>"Half-a-crown!&mdash;and that's nine months ago!"</p>

<p>"Do, Hucky, do lend me a few shillings. 'Pon my
soul, I've not a sixpence in the whole world."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! A pretty chap to borrow! You can pay
so well! By George, Titmouse, you're a cool hand!"</p>

<p>"If you won't lend me, I must starve."</p>

<p>"Go to <i>my uncle's</i>." [Titmouse groaned aloud.] "Well&mdash;and
why not? What of that?" continued Huckaback,
sharply and bitterly. "I dare say it wouldn't be the
first time you've done such a trick no more than me.
I've been obligated to do it. Why shouldn't you? A'n't
there that ring?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord! oh, Lord! that's just what Mrs. Squallop
said last night!"</p>

<p>"Whew! <i>She's</i> down on you, is she? And you have
the face to come to me!! <i>You</i>&mdash;that's a-going to be
sold up, come to borrow! Lord, that's good, anyhow!
A queer use that to make of one's friends;&mdash;it's a taking
them in, I say!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Huck, Huck, if you only knew what a poor devil"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what I was a-saying; but it a'n't 'poor
devils' one lends money to so easily, I warrant me;
though you <i>a'n't</i> such a poor devil&mdash;you're only shamming!
Where's your guard-chain, your studs, your
breast-pin, your ring, and all that? Sell 'em! if not,
anyhow, <i>pawn</i> 'em. Can't eat your cake and have it;
fine back must have empty belly with us sort of chaps."</p>

<p>"If you'll only be so uncommon kind as to lend me&mdash;this
once&mdash;ten shillings," continued Titmouse, in an imploring
tone, "I'll bind myself, by a solemn oath, to
pay you the very first moment I get what's due to me
from Tag-rag &amp; Co."&mdash;&mdash; Here he was almost choked
by the sudden recollection that he had next to nothing
to receive.</p>

<p>"You've some property in the <span class="smcap">moon</span>, too, that's coming
to you, you know!" said Huckaback, with an insulting sneer.</p>

<p>"I know what you're driving at," said poor Titmouse;
and he continued eagerly, "and if anything <i>should</i> ever
come up from Messrs. Quirk, Gam"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yough! Faugh! Pish! Stuff!" burst out Huckaback,
in a tone of contempt and disgust; "<i>never</i> thought there
was anything in it, and now <i>know</i> it! It's all my eye,
and all that! You've been only humbugging me all this while!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Hucky, Hucky! You don't say so!" groaned
Titmouse, bursting into tears; "you did not <i>always</i> say so."</p>

<p>"It's enough that I say it <i>now</i>, then; will that do?"
interrupted Huckaback, impetuously.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, Lord! what is to become of me?" cried
Titmouse, with a face full of anguish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>[At this moment, the following was the course of thought
passing through the mind of Mr. Huckaback:&mdash;It is not
<i>certain</i> that nothing will come of the fellow's affair with
Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap. It was hardly likely
that they would have gone as far as Titmouse represented,
(lawyers as they were), unless they had seen very substantial
grounds for doing so. Besides, even though Titmouse
might not get ten thousand a-year, he might yet
succeed in obtaining a very splendid sum of money: and
if he (Huckaback) could but get a little slice out of it,
Titmouse was now nearly desperate, and would promise
anything; and if he could but be wheedled into giving
anything in writing&mdash;Well, thought Huckaback, I'll try it however!]</p>

<p>"Ah, Titmouse, you're civil enough <i>now</i>, and would
<i>promise</i> anything," said Huckaback, appearing to hesitate;
"but supposing I were to do what you want, when you
got your money you'd forget everything about it"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Forget my promise! Dear Hucky! only try me&mdash;do
try me but once, that's all! 'Pon my precious life,
ten shillings is worth more to me now than a hundred
pounds may be by-and-by."</p>

<p>"Ay, so you say <i>now</i>; but d'ye mean to tell me, that
in case I <i>was</i> now to advance you ten shillings out of my
small salary," continued Huckaback, apparently carelessly,
"you'd, for instance, pay me a hundred pounds out of
your thousands?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord! only you try me&mdash;do try me!" said Titmouse, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I dare say!" interrupted Huckaback, smiling incredulously,
and chinking some money in his trousers
pocket. Titmouse heard it, and (as the phrase is) his
teeth watered; and he immediately swore such a tremendous
oath as I dare not set down in writing, that if
Huckaback would that evening lend him ten shillings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Titmouse would give him one hundred pounds out of the
very first moneys he got from the estate.</p>

<p>"Ten shillings is a slapping slice out of my little
salary&mdash;I shall have, by George, to go without lots of
things I'd intended getting; it's really worth ten pounds
to me, just now."</p>

<p>"Why, dear Hucky! 'pon my life, 't&nbsp;is worth a hundred
to <i>me</i>! Mrs. Squallop will sell me out, bag and
baggage, if I don't give her something to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"Well, if I really thought&mdash;hem!&mdash;would you mind
giving me, now, a bit of black and white for it&mdash;just (as
one might say) to show you was in earnest?"</p>

<p>"I'll do anything you like; only let me feel the ten
shillings in my fingers!"</p>

<p>"Well, no sooner said than done, if you're a man of
your word," said Huckaback, in a trice producing a bit
of paper, and a pen and ink. "So, only just for the fun
of it; but&mdash;Lord! what stuff!&mdash;I'm only bargaining
for a hundred pounds of moonshine. Ha, ha! I shall
never see the color of your money, not I; so I may
as well say two hundred when I'm about it, as one hundred"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, hem! Two hundred, Huck, <i>is</i> rather a large
figure; one hundred's odds enough, I'm sure!" quoth
Titmouse, meekly.</p>

<p>"P'r'aps, Tit, you forget the <i>licking</i> you gave me the
other day," said Huckaback, with sudden sternness. "Suppose
I was to go to an attorney, and get the law of you,
what a sight of damages I should have&mdash;three hundred
pounds at least!"</p>

<p>Titmouse appeared even yet hesitating.</p>

<p>"Well, then!" said Huckaback, flinging down his pen,
"suppose I have them damages yet"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, come, Hucky, 't&nbsp;is all past and gone, all that"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is it? Well, I never! I shall never be again the
same man I was before that 'ere licking. I've a sort of
a&mdash;a&mdash;of a&mdash;feeling inside, as if&mdash;my breast was&mdash;I
shall carry it to my grave&mdash;curse me if I sha'n't!"</p>

<p>[It never once occurred to Titmouse, not having his
friend Mr. Gammon at his elbow, that the plaintiff in the
action of <i>Huckaback v. Titmouse</i> might have been slightly
at a loss for a <i>witness</i> of the assault; but something quite
as good in its way&mdash;a heaven-sent suggestion&mdash;<i>did</i> occur
to him.]</p>

<p>"Ah," said Titmouse, suddenly, "that's true; and uncommon
sorry am I; but still, a hundred pounds is a
hundred pounds, and a large sum for the use of ten shillings,
and a licking; but never you think it's all moonshine
about my business with Messrs. Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap! I didn't intend to have said a word&mdash;but&mdash;you
should only have heard what <i>I've</i> heard to-day
from those gents; hem! but I won't split <i>again</i> either!"
he added mysteriously.</p>

<p>"Eh? What? Heard from those gents at Saffron
Hill?" interrupted Huckaback, briskly; "come, Titty,
out with it&mdash;out with it; no secrets between friends, Titty!"</p>

<p>"No, I'll be hanged if I do&mdash;I won't spoil it all again;
and now, since I've let out as much, which I didn't mean
to do, I'll tell you something else&mdash;ten shillings is no
use to me, I must have a pound."</p>

<p>"Titty, Titty!" exclaimed Huckaback, with unaffected concern.</p>

<p>"And I won't give more than fifty for it when I get
my property either"&mdash;&mdash; [Huckaback whistled aloud, and
with a significant air buttoned up the pocket which contained
the money; intimating that now the negotiation
was all at an end, for that Titmouse's new terms were
quite out of the question;] "for I know where I can get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
twenty pounds easily, only I liked to come to a <i>friend</i> first."</p>

<p>"You aren't behaving much like a friend to one as
has always been a fast friend of yours, Titty! <i>A pound!</i>&mdash;I
haven't got it to part with, that's flat; so, if that's
really your lowest figure, why, you must even go to your
other friend, and leave poor Hucky!"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't mind saying only ten shillings," quoth
Titmouse, fearing that he had been going on <i>rather</i> too fast.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's something reasonable-like, Titty! and to
meet you like a friend, I'll take fifty pounds instead of a
hundred; but you won't object now to&mdash;you know&mdash;a
deposit; that ring of yours&mdash;well, well! it don't signify,
since it goes against you; so now, here goes, a bit of
paper for ten shillings, ha, ha!" and taking a pen, after
a pause, in which he called to mind as much of the phraseology
of money securities as he could, he drew up the
following stringent document, which I give <i>verbatim et literatim</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Know all Men</i> That you are bound to <i>Mr. R. Huckaback</i>
Promising the Bearer (on <i>Demand</i>) To Pay Fifty Pounds in
cash out of the estate, <i>if you Get it</i>. (Value received.)</p>

<p>"(Witness,) 22d July 18&mdash;.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">R. Huckaback.</span>"</p></div>

<p>"There, Titty&mdash;if you're an honest man, and would do
as you would be done by," said Huckaback, after signing
his own name as above, handing the pen to Titmouse,
"sign that; just to show your honor, like&mdash;for in course&mdash;bating
the ten shillings I've lent you&mdash;I sha'n't ever
come on you for the money&mdash;get as much as you may."</p>

<p>A blessed thought occurred to poor Titmouse in his extremity,
viz. that there was <i>no stamp</i> on the above instrument,
(and he had never seen a promissory-note or bill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
of exchange without one;) and he signed it instantly,
with many fervent expressions of gratitude. Huckaback
received the valuable security with apparently a careless
air; and after cramming it into his pocket, as if it had
been in reality only a bit of waste paper, counted out ten
shillings into the eager hand of Titmouse; who, having
thus most unexpectedly succeeded in his mission, soon
afterwards departed&mdash;each of this pair of worthies fancying
that he had succeeded in cheating the other. Huckaback,
having very cordially shaken Titmouse by the
hand, heartily damned him upon shutting the door on
him; and then anxiously perused and re-perused his
"security," wondering whether it was possible for Titmouse
at any time thereafter to evade it, and considering
by what means he could acquaint himself with the progress
of Titmouse's affairs. The latter gentleman, as he
hurried homeward, dwelt for a long while upon only one
thought&mdash;how fortunate was the omission of his friend
to have a stamp upon his security! When and where,
thought he, was it that he had heard that nothing would
do without a stamp? However, he had got the ten shillings
safe; and Huckaback might wait for his fifty pounds
till&mdash;but in the meanwhile he, Titmouse, seemed to stand
a fair chance of going to the dogs; the ten shillings, which
he had just obtained with so much difficulty, were to find
their way immediately into the pockets of his landlady,
whom it might pacify for a day or two, and to what quarter
was he now to look for the smallest assistance? What
was to become of him? Titmouse was a miserable fool;
but thoughts such as these, in such circumstances as his,
would have forced themselves into the mind of even a
fool! How could he avoid&mdash;oh, horrid thought!&mdash;soon
parting with, or at least pawning, his ring and his other
precious trinkets? He burst into a perspiration at the
mere thought of seeing them hanging ticketed for sale in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the window of old Balls! As he slowly ascended the
stairs which led to his apartment, he felt as if he were
following some unseen conductor to a dungeon.</p>

<p>He was not aware that all this while, although he heard
nothing from them, he occupied almost exclusively the
thoughts of those distinguished practitioners in the law,
Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap. They, in common with
Huckaback, had an intense desire to share in his anticipated
good fortune, and determined to do so according to
their opportunities. The excellent Huckaback (a model
of an usurer on a small scale) had promptly and adroitly
seized hold of the very first opportunity that presented
itself, for securing a little return hereafter for the ten
shillings, with which he had so generously parted when
he could so ill afford it; while Messrs. Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap were racking their brains, and from time to
time, those of Messrs. Mortmain and Frankpledge, to discover
some instrument strong and large enough to cut a
fat slice for themselves out of the fortune they were endeavoring,
for that purpose, to put within the reach of
Mr. Titmouse. A rule of three mode of stating the matter
would be thus: as the inconvenience of Huckaback's parting
with his ten shillings and his waiver of damages for a
very cruel assault, were to his contingent gain, hereafter,
of fifty pounds; so were Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and
Snap's risk, exertions, outlay, and benefit conferred on Titmouse,
to their contingent gain of ten thousand pounds.
The principal point of difference between them was&mdash;as
to the mode of <i>securing</i> their future recompense; in which
it may have been observed by the attentive reader, with
respect to the precipitancy of Huckaback and the hesitating
caution of Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, that&mdash;"<i>thus
fools</i>" (<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i> Huckaback) "<i>rushed in where angels</i>"
(<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap) "<i>feared to tread</i>."
Let me not, however, for a moment, insinuate that both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
these parties were actuated by only one motive, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to
make a prey of this little monkey <i>millionnaire</i> that was
to be. 'Tis true that Huckaback appears to have driven
rather a hard bargain with his distressed friend, (and almost
every one who, being similarly situated, has occasion
for such services as Titmouse sought from Huckaback,
will find himself called upon to pay, in one way or another,
pretty nearly the same price for them;) but it was
attended with one good effect;&mdash;for the specific interest
in Titmouse's future prosperity, acquired by Huckaback,
quickened the latter gentleman's energies and sharpened
his wits in the service of his friend. But for this, indeed, it
is probable that Mr. Huckaback's door would have become
as hopelessly closed against Titmouse as was that of
Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap. Some two or three
nights after the little transaction between the two friends
which I have been describing, Huckaback called upon Titmouse,
and after greeting him rather cordially, told him
that he had come to put him up to a trick upon the Saffron
Hill people, that would tickle them into a little activity
in his affairs. The trick was&mdash;the sending a letter
to those gentlemen calculated to&mdash;but why attempt to
characterize it? I have the original document lying before
me, which was sent by Titmouse the very next morning
to Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap; and here follows
a <i>verbatim</i> copy of it:&mdash;</p>

<p>Old Mr. Quirk, as soon as he had finished the perusal
of this skilful document, started, a little disturbed, from
his seat, and bustled into Mr. Gammon's room with Mr.
Titmouse's open letter in his hand.&mdash;"Gammon," said
he, "just cast your eye over this, will you? Really, we
must look after Titmouse, or, by Jove! he'll be gone!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Mr. Gammon took the letter rather eagerly, read deliberately
through it, and then looked up at his fidgety partner,
who stood anxiously eying him, and smiled.</p>

<p>"Well, Gammon, I really think&mdash;eh? Don't you"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Upon my word, Mr. Quirk, this nearly equals his last
letter; and it also seems to have produced on you the
effect desired by its gifted writer!"</p>

<p>"Well, Gammon, and what of that? Because my
heart don't happen to be <i>quite</i> a piece of flint, you're always"&mdash;</p>

<p>"You might have been a far wealthier man than you
are but for that soft heart of yours, Mr. Quirk," said Gammon,
with a bland smile.(!)</p>

<p>"I know I might, Gammon&mdash;I know it. I thank my
God I'm not so keen after business that I can't feel for
this poor soul&mdash;really, his state's quite deplorable."</p>

<p>"Then, my dear sir, put your hand into your pocket
at once, as I was suggesting last night, and allow him a
weekly sum."</p>

<p>"A&mdash;hem! hem! Gammon"&mdash;said Quirk, sitting down,
thrusting his hands into his waistcoat pockets, and looking
very earnestly at Gammon.</p>

<p>"Well, then," replied that gentleman, shrugging his
shoulders, in answer to the mute appeal&mdash;"write and
say you <i>won't</i>&mdash;'tis soon done, and so the matter ends."</p>

<p>"Why, Gammon, you see, if he goes abroad," said
Quirk, after a long pause&mdash;"we lose him forever."</p>

<p>"Pho!&mdash;go abroad! He's too much for you, Mr. Quirk&mdash;he
is indeed, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"You're fond of a laugh at my expense, Gammon; it's
quite pleasant&mdash;you can't think how I like that laugh of yours!"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Mr. Quirk&mdash;but you really misunderstand
me; I was laughing only at the absurd inconsistency
of the fellow: he's a most transparent little fool,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and takes <i>us</i> for such. Go abroad! Ridiculous pretence!&mdash;In
his precious postscript he undoes all&mdash;he says he is
only often <i>thinking</i> of going&mdash;- pshaw!&mdash;That the wretch
is in great distress, is very probable; but it must go hard
with him before he either commits suicide or goes abroad,
I warrant him: I've no fears on <i>that</i> score&mdash;but there <i>is</i>
a point in the letter that may be worth considering&mdash;I
mean the fellow's hint about borrowing money on his prospects."</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure&mdash;the very thing that struck <i>me</i>."
[Gammon faintly smiled.] "I never thought much about
the <i>other</i> part of the letter&mdash;all stuff about going
abroad&mdash;pho!&mdash;But to be sure, if he's trying to raise money,
he may get into keen hands.&mdash;Do you really think he
<i>has</i> been trying on anything of the sort?"</p>

<p>"Oh no&mdash;of course it's only a little lie of his&mdash;or he
must have found out some greater fool than himself,
which I had not supposed possible. But however that
may be, I really think, Mr. Quirk, it's high time that we
should take some decided step."</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;yes, it may be," said Quirk, slowly&mdash;"and
I must say that Mortmain encouraged me a good deal the
day before yesterday."</p>

<p>"Well, and you know what Mr. Frankpledge"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, as to Frankpledge&mdash;hem!"</p>

<p>"What of Mr. Frankpledge, Mr. Quirk?" inquired Gammon,
rather tartly.</p>

<p>"There! there!&mdash;Always the way&mdash;but what does it
signify? Come, come, Gammon, we know each other too
well to quarrel!&mdash;I don't mean anything disrespectful to
Mr. Frankpledge, but when Mortmain has been one's conveyancer
these twenty years, and never once&mdash;hem!&mdash;but,
however, he tells me that we are now standing on
sure ground, or that he don't know what sure ground is,
and sees no objection to our even taking preliminary steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
in the matter, which indeed I begin to think it high time
to do!&mdash;And as for securing ourselves in respect of any
advances to Titmouse&mdash;he suggests our taking a bond,
conditioned&mdash;say, for the payment of £500 or £1,000 on
demand, under cover of which one might advance him,
you know, just such sums as, and when we pleased; one
could stop when one thought fit; one could begin with
three or four pounds a-week, and increase as his prospects
improved&mdash;eh!"</p>

<p>"You know <i>I've</i> no objection to such an arrangement;
but consider, Mr. Quirk, we must have patience; it will
take a long while to get our verdict, you know, and perhaps
as long to <i>secure</i> it afterwards; and this horrid little
wretch all the while on our hands; what the deuce to do
with him, I really don't know!"</p>

<p>"Humph, humph!" grunted Quirk, looking very earnestly
and uneasily at Gammon.</p>

<p>"And what I chiefly fear is this,&mdash;suppose he should
get dissatisfied with the amount of our advances, and,
knowing the state and prospects of the cause, should
<i>then</i> turn restive?"</p>

<p>"Ay, confound it, Gammon, all that should be looked
to, shouldn't it?" interrupted Quirk, with an exceedingly
chagrined air. "I always like to look a long way a-head!"</p>

<p>"To be sure," continued Gammon, thoughtfully; "by
that time he may have got substantial friends about him,
whom he could persuade to become security to us for further
and past advances."</p>

<p>"Nay, now you name the thing, Gammon; it was what
I was thinking of only the other day:" he dropped his
voice&mdash;"Isn't there one or two of our own clients, hem!"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, there's old Fang; I don't think it
impossible he might be induced to do a little usury&mdash;it's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
all he lives for, Mr. Quirk; and the security is good in
reality, though perhaps not exactly marketable."</p>

<p>"Nay; but, on second thoughts, why not do it myself,
if anything <i>can</i> be made of it?"</p>

<p>"That, however, will be for future consideration. In
the mean time, we'd better send for Titmouse, and manage
him a little more&mdash;discreetly, eh? We did not
exactly hit it off last time, did we, Mr. Quirk?" said
Gammon, smiling rather sarcastically. "We must keep
him at Tag-rag's, if the thing <i>can</i> be done for the present,
at all events."</p>

<p>"To be sure; he couldn't then come buzzing about us,
like a gad-fly; he'd drive us mad in a week, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd rather give up everything than submit to it.
It can't be difficult for us, I should think, to bind him to
our own terms&mdash;to put a bridle in the ass's mouth? Let
us say that we insist on his signing an undertaking to act
implicitly according to our directions in everything."</p>

<p>"Ay, to be sure; on pain of our instantly turning him
to the right about. I fancy it will <i>do</i> now! It was just
what I was thinking of!"</p>

<p>"And, now, Mr. Quirk," said Gammon, with as much
of peremptoriness in his tone as he could venture upon to
Mr. Quirk, "you really must do me the favor to leave the
management of this little wretch to me. You see, he
seems to have taken&mdash;Heaven save the mark!&mdash;a fancy
to me, poor fool!&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;it must be owned we
miscarried sadly, the other night, on a certain grand
occasion&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>Quirk shook his head dissentingly.</p>

<p>"Well, then," continued Gammon, "upon one thing I
am fixedly determined; one or the other of us shall undertake
Titmouse, solely and singly. Pray, for Heaven's sake,
tackle him yourself&mdash;a disagreeable duty! You know,
my dear sir, how invariably I leave everything of real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
importance and difficulty to your very superior tact and
experience; but <i>this</i> little matter&mdash;pshaw!"</p>

<p>"Come, come, Gammon, that's a drop of sweet oil"&mdash;</p>

<p>Quirk might well say so, for he felt its softening,
smoothing effects already.</p>

<p>"Upon my word and honor, Mr. Quirk, I'm in earnest.
Pshaw!&mdash;and you must know it. I know you too well,
my dear sir, to attempt to"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Certainly," quoth Quirk, smiling shrewdly, "I must
say, those must get up <i>very</i> early that can find Caleb
Quirk napping."&mdash;Gammon felt at that moment that
for several years <i>he</i> must have been a very early riser!
And so the matter was arranged in the manner which
Gammon had from the first wished and determined upon,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> that Mr. Titmouse should be left entirely to his management;
and, after some little discussion as to the time
and manner of the meditated advances, the partners
parted. On entering his own room, Quirk, closing his
door, stood for some time leaning against the side of the
window, with his hands in his pockets, and his eyes instinctively
resting on his banker's book, which lay on the
table. He was in a very brown study, the subject on
which his thoughts were busied, being the prudence or
imprudence of leaving Titmouse thus in the hands of
Gammon. It might be all very well for Quirk to <i>assert</i>
his self-confidence when in Gammon's presence; but he
did not really feel it. He never left Gammon after any
little difference of opinion, however friendly, without a
secret suspicion that somehow or another Gammon had
been too much for him, and always gained his purposes
without giving Quirk any handle of dissatisfaction. In
fact, Quirk was thoroughly afraid of Gammon, and Gammon
knew it. In the present instance, an undefinable
but increasing suspicion and discomfort forced him presently
back again into Gammon's room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"I say, Gammon, you understand, eh?&mdash;<i>Fair play</i>,
you know," he commenced, with a shy embarrassed air,
ill concealed under a forced smile.</p>

<p>"Pray, Mr. Quirk, what may be your meaning?" inquired
Gammon, with unusual tartness, with an astonished
air, and blushing violently, which was not surprising; for
ever since Quirk had quitted him, Gammon's thoughts
had been occupied with only one question, viz. how he
should go to work with Titmouse to satisfy him that he
(Gammon) was the only member of the firm that had a
real disinterested regard for him, and so acquire a valuable
control over him! Thus occupied, the observation of
Quirk had completely taken Gammon aback; and he lost
his presence of mind, of course in such case his <i>temper</i>
quickly following. "Will you favor me, Mr. Quirk, with
an explanation of your extraordinarily absurd and offensive
observation?" said he, reddening more and more as
he looked at Mr. Quirk.</p>

<p>"You're a queer hand, Gammon," replied Quirk, with
almost an equally surprised and embarrassed air, for he
could not resist a sort of conviction that Gammon had
fathomed what had been passing in his mind.</p>

<p>"What did you mean, Mr. Quirk, by your singular
observation just now?" said Gammon, calmly, having
recovered his presence of mind.</p>

<p>"Mean? Why, that&mdash;we're <i>both</i> queer hands, Gammon,
ha, ha, ha!" answered Quirk, with an anxious laugh.</p>

<p>"I shall leave Titmouse entirely&mdash;<i>entirely</i>, Mr. Quirk,
in your hands; I will have nothing henceforth whatever
to do with him. I am quite sick of him and his concerns
already; I cannot bring myself to undertake such an affair,
and that was what I was thinking of,&mdash;when"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Eh? indeed! Well, to be sure! Only think!" said
Quirk, dropping his voice, looking to see that the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
doors were shut, and resuming the chair which he had
lately quitted, "What do you think has been occurring
to <i>me</i> in my own room, just now? Whether it would suit
us better to throw this monkey overboard, put ourselves
confidentially in communication with the party in possession,
and tell him that&mdash;hem!&mdash;for a&mdash;eh? You understand&mdash;eh?
a con-si-de-ra-tion&mdash;a <i>suitable</i> con-si-de-ra-tion!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Quirk! Heavens!" Gammon was really amazed.</p>

<p>"Well? You needn't open your eyes so very wide,
Mr. Gammon&mdash;why shouldn't it be done? You know
we wouldn't be satisfied with a trifle, of course. But
suppose he'd agreed to buy our silence with four or
five thousand pounds, really, it's well worth considering!
Upon my soul, Gammon, it <i>is</i> a hard thing on
him when one makes the case one's own!&mdash;no fault of
his, and it is very hard for him to turn out, and for such
a&mdash;eugh!&mdash;such a wretch as Titmouse; you'd feel it
yourself, Gammon, if you were in his place, and I'm
sure you'd think that four or five thous"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"But is not Titmouse our <span class="smcap">Poor Neighbor</span>?" said
Gammon, with a sly smile.</p>

<p>"Why, <i>that's</i> only one way of looking at it, Gammon!
Perhaps the man we are going to eject does a vast deal of
good with the property; certainly he bears a very high
name in the county&mdash;and fancy Titmouse with ten thousand a-year!"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Quirk, Mr. Quirk, it's not to be thought of for
a moment&mdash;not for a moment," interrupted Gammon,
seriously, and even somewhat peremptorily&mdash;"nothing
should persuade <i>me</i> to be any party to such"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>At this moment Snap burst into the room with a heated
appearance, and a chagrined air&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Pitch</i> v. <i>Grub</i>&mdash;&mdash;" he commenced breathlessly&mdash;</p>

<p>[This was a little pet action of poor Snap's: it was for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
slander uttered by the defendant (an hostler) against the
plaintiff, (a waterman on a coach stand,) charging the
plaintiff with having <i>the mange</i>, on account of which a
woman refused to marry him.]</p>

<p>"Pitch v. Grub&mdash;just been tried at Guildhall. Witness
bang up to the mark&mdash;words and special damage
proved; slapping speech from Sergeant Shout. Verdict
for plaintiff&mdash;but only one farthing damages; and Lord
Widdrington said, as the jury had given one farthing for
damages, <i>he</i> would give him another for costs,[<a href='#Note_10'>10</a>] and that
would make a halfpenny; on which the defendant's attorney
tendered me&mdash;a halfpenny on the spot. Laughter
in court&mdash;move for new trial first day of next term, and
tip his lordship a rattler in the next Sunday's <i>Flash</i>!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Quirk," said Gammon, sternly, "once for all, if
this sort of low business is to go on, I'll leave the firm,
come what will!" [It flickered across his mind that Titmouse
would be a capital client to start with on his own
account.] "I protest our names will quite stink in the profession."</p>

<p>"Good, Mr. Gammon, good!" interposed Snap, warmly;
"your little action for the usury penalties the other day
came off so uncommon well! the judge's compliment to
you was <i>so</i> nice"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let me tell you, Mr. Snap," interrupted Gammon, reddening&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pho! Come! Can't be helped&mdash;fortune of the war,"&mdash;interrupted
the head of the firm,&mdash;"there's only one
thing to be looked to,&mdash;<i>Is Pitch solvent?</i>&mdash;of course
we've security for costs out of pocket&mdash;eh, Snap?"</p>

<p>Now the fact was, that poor Snap had picked up Pitch at
one of the police offices, and, in his zeal for business, had
undertaken his case on pure speculation, relying on the apparent
strength of the plaintiff's case&mdash;Pitch being only a
waterman attached to a coach stand. When, therefore, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
very ominous question of Mr. Quirk met Snap's ear, he suddenly
happened (at least, he chose to appear to think so)
to hear himself called for from the clerk's room, and bolted
out of Mr. Gammon's room rather unceremoniously.</p>

<p>"Snap will be the ruin of the firm, Mr. Quirk," said
Gammon, with an air of disgust. "But I really must get
on with the brief I'm drawing; so, Mr. Quirk, we can talk
about Titmouse to-morrow!"</p>

<p>The brief he was drawing up was for a defendant
who was going to nonsuit the plaintiff, (a man with a
large family, who had kindly lent the defendant a considerable
sum of money,) solely because of the <i>want of a stamp</i>.</p>

<p>Quirk differed in opinion with Gammon, and, as he resumed
his seat at his desk, he could not help writing the
words, "<i>Quirk and Snap</i>," and thinking how well such a
firm would sound and work&mdash;for Snap was verily a chip
of the old block!</p>

<p>There will probably never be wanting those who will
join in abusing and ridiculing attorneys and solicitors.
Why? In almost every action at law, or suit in equity,
or proceeding which may, or may not, lead to one, each
client conceives a natural dislike for his opponent's attorney
or solicitor. <i>If the plaintiff succeeds</i>, he hates the defendant's
attorney for putting him (the said plaintiff) to
so much expense, and causing him so much vexation and
danger; and, when he comes to settle with his own attorney,
there is not a little heart-burning in looking at his
bill of costs, however reasonable. <i>If the plaintiff fails</i>, of
course it is through the ignorance and unskilfulness of his
attorney or solicitor! and he hates almost equally his own,
and his opponent's attorney!&mdash;Precisely so is it with a
successful or unsuccessful <i>defendant</i>. In fact, an attorney
or solicitor is almost always obliged to be acting <i>adversely
to some one</i> of whom he at once makes an enemy; for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
attorney's weapons must necessarily be pointed almost
invariably at our pockets! He is necessarily, also, called
into action in cases when all the worst passions of our
nature&mdash;our hatred and revenge, and our self-interest&mdash;are
set in motion. Consider the mischief which might be
constantly done on a grand scale in society, if the vast
majority of attorneys and solicitors were not honorable,
and able men! Conceive them, for a moment, disposed
everywhere to stir up litigation, by availing themselves of
their perfect acquaintance with almost all men's circumstances&mdash;artfully
inflaming irritable and vindictive clients,
kindling, instead of stifling, family dissensions, and
fomenting public strife&mdash;why, were they to do only a
hundredth part of what it is thus in their power to do,
our courts of justice would soon be doubled, together with
the number of our judges, counsel, and attorneys; new
jails must be built to hold the ruined litigants&mdash;and the
insolvent court enlarged, and in constant session throughout the year.</p>

<p>But not <i>all</i> of this body of honorable and valuable men
are entitled to this tribute of praise. There are a few
<span class="smcap">Quirks</span>, several <span class="smcap">Gammons</span>, and many <span class="smcap">Snaps</span>, in the profession
of the law&mdash;men whose characters and doings often
make fools visit the sins of individuals upon the whole
species; nay, there are far worse, as I have heard&mdash;but
I must return to my narrative.</p>

<p>On Friday night, the 28th July 18&mdash;, the state of Mr.
Titmouse's affairs was this; he owed his landlady £1, 9s.;
his washerwoman, 6s.; his tailor, £1, 8s.&mdash;in all, three
guineas; besides 10s. to Huckaback, (for Tittlebat's notion
was, that on repayment at any time of 10s., Huckaback
would be bound to deliver up to him the document or
voucher which he had given that gentleman,) and a weekly
accruing rent of 7s. to his landlady, besides some very
small sums for coffee, (alias chiccory,) tea, bread, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
butter, &amp;c. To meet these serious liabilities, he had
literally&mdash;<i>not one farthing</i>.</p>

<p>On returning to his lodgings that night, he found a line
from Thumbscrew, his landlady's broker, informing him
that, unless by ten o'clock on the next morning his arrears
of rent were paid, he should distrain, and she would
also give him notice to quit at the end of the week; that
nothing could induce her to give him further time. He
sat down in dismay on reading this threatening document;
and, in sitting down, his eye fell on a bit of paper
lying on the floor, which must have been thrust under the
door. From the marks on it, it was evident that he must
have trod upon it in entering. It proved to be a summons
from the Court of Requests, for £1, 8s. due to Job
Cox, his tailor. He deposited it mechanically on the
table; and for a minute he dared hardly breathe.</p>

<p>This seemed something really like a <i>crisis</i>.</p>

<p>After a silent agony of half an hour's duration, he rose
trembling from his chair, blew out his candle, and, in a
few minutes' time, might have been seen standing with a
pale and troubled face before the window of old Balls, the
pawnbroker, peering through the suspended articles&mdash;watches,
sugar-tongs, rings, brooches, spoons, pins, bracelets,
knives and forks, seals, chains, &amp;c.&mdash;to see whether
any one else than old Balls were within. Having at
length watched out a very pale and wretched-looking woman,
Titmouse entered to take her place; and after interchanging
a few faltering words with the white-haired
and hard-hearted old pawnbroker, produced his guard-chain,
his breast-pin, and his ring, and obtained three
pounds two shillings and sixpence on the security of them.</p>

<p>With this sum he slunk out of the shop, and calling on
Cox, his tailor, paid his trembling old creditor the full
amount of his claim (£1, 8s.) together with 4s., the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
expense of the summons&mdash;simply asking for a receipt, without
uttering another word, for he felt almost choked. In
the same way he dealt with Mrs. Squallop, his landlady&mdash;not
uttering one word in reply to her profuse and voluble
apologies, but pressing his lips between his teeth till the
blood came from them, while his little heart seemed splitting
within him. Then he walked up-stairs, with a desperate
air&mdash;having just eighteen pence in his pocket&mdash;<i>all
his ornaments gone</i>&mdash;his washerwoman yet unpaid&mdash;his
rent going on&mdash;several other little matters unsettled;
and the 10th of August approaching, when he expected
to be dismissed penniless from Mr. Tag-rag's and thrown
on his own resources for subsistence. When he had regained
his room, and having shut the door, had re-seated
himself at his table, he felt for a moment as if he could
have yelled. Starvation and Despair, two fiends, seemed
sitting beside him in shadowy ghastliness, chilling and
palsying him&mdash;petrifying his heart within him. <span class="smcap">What
was he to do?</span> Why had he been born? Why was he so
much more persecuted and miserable than any one else?
Visions of his ring, his breast-pin, his studs, stuck in a
bit of card, with their price written above them, and
hanging exposed to his view in old Balls' window, almost
frenzied him. Thoughts such as these at length began
to suggest others of a dreadful nature.... The means
were at that instant within his reach.... A sharp
knock at the door startled him out of the stupor into
which he was sinking. He listened for a moment as
if he were not certain that the sound was a real one.
There seemed a ton-weight upon his heart, which a
mighty sigh could lift for an instant, but not remove;
and he was in the act of heaving a second such sigh, as
he languidly opened the door&mdash;expecting to encounter
Mr. Thumbscrew, or some of his myrmidons, who might
not know of his recent settlement with his landlady.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is this Mr.&mdash;Tit&mdash;Titmouse's?" inquired a genteel-looking
young man.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Titmouse, sadly.</p>

<p>"Are you Mr. Titmouse?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, more faintly than before.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I have brought you, sir, a letter from Mr.
Gammon, of the firm of Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, solicitors,
Saffron Hill," said the stranger, unconscious that his
words shot a flash of light into a little abyss of grief and
despair before him. "He begged me to give this letter
into your own hands, and said he hoped you'd send him
an answer by the first morning's post."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;oh&mdash;I see&mdash;certainly&mdash;to be sure&mdash;with
pleasure&mdash;how is Mr. Gammon?&mdash;uncommon kind of
him&mdash;very humble respects to him&mdash;take care to answer
it," stammered Titmouse, in a breath, hardly knowing
whether he were standing on his head or his heels,
and not quite certain where he was.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, sir," replied the stranger, evidently
a little surprised at Titmouse's manner, and withdrew.
Titmouse shut his door. With prodigious trepidation of
hand and flutter of spirits, he opened the letter&mdash;an enclosure
meeting his eyes in the shape of a bank-note.</p>

<p>"Oh Lord!" he murmured, turning white as the sheet
of paper he held. Then the letter dropped from his hand,
and he stood as if stupefied for some moments; but presently
rapture darted through him; a five-pound bank-note
was in his hand, and it had been enclosed in the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='sigr' style='margin-left:1em;'>"<i>35, Thavies' Inn, 29th July 18&mdash;.</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Titmouse</span>,</p>

<p>"Your last note addressed to our firm, has given me the
greatest pain, and I hasten, on my return from the country, to
forward you the enclosed trifle, out of my own personal resources&mdash;and
I sincerely hope it will be of temporary service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
to you. May I beg the favor of your company on Sunday
evening next, at seven o'clock, to take a glass of wine with me?
I shall be quite alone and disengaged, and may have it in my
power to make you some important communications, concerning
matters in which, I assure you, I feel a very deep interest
on your account. Begging the favor of an early answer to-morrow
morning, I trust you will believe me, ever, my dear sir,
your most faithful humble servant,</p>

<p class='sigr' style='margin-left:1em;'>"<span class="smcap">Oily Gammon.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">"Tittlebat Titmouse, Esq."</span></p></div>

<p>The first balmy drop of the long-expected golden shower
had at length fallen upon the panting Titmouse. How
polite&mdash;nay, how affectionate and respectful&mdash;was the
note of Mr. Gammon! and, for the first time in his life,
he saw himself addressed</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='sigc'>"<span class="smcap">Tittlebat Titmouse, Esquire.</span>"</p></div>

<p>If his room had been large enough to admit of it, he
would have skipped round it again and again in his frantic
ecstasy. Having read over several times the blessed
letter of Mr. Gammon, he hastily folded it up, crumpled
up the bank-note in his hand, clapped his hat on his head,
blew out his candle, rushed down-stairs as if a mad dog
were at his heels, and in three or four minutes' time
might have been seen standing breathless before old
Balls, whom he had almost electrified by asking, with
an eager and joyous air, for a return of the articles which
he had only an hour before pawned with him; at the
same time laying down the duplicates and the bank-note.
The latter, old Balls scrutinized with most anxious exactness,
and even suspicion&mdash;but it seemed perfectly unexceptionable;
so he re-delivered to Titmouse his precious
ornaments, and the change out of his note, <i>minus</i> a trifling
sum for interest. Titmouse then started off at top
speed to Huckaback; but it suddenly occurring to him
as possible that that gentleman, on hearing of his good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
fortune, might look for an immediate repayment of the
ten shillings he had recently lent to Titmouse, he stopped
short&mdash;paused&mdash;and returned home. There he had
hardly been seated a moment, when down he pelted
again, to buy a sheet of paper and a wafer or two, to
write his letter to Mr. Gammon; which having obtained,
he returned at the same speed, almost overturning his fat
landlady, who looked after him as though he were a mad
cat scampering up and down-stairs, and fearing that he
had gone suddenly crazy. The note he wrote to Mr.
Gammon was so exceedingly extravagant, that, candid
as I have (I trust) hitherto shown myself in the delineation
of Mr. Titmouse's character, I cannot bring myself
to give the aforesaid letter to the reader&mdash;making
all allowances for the extraordinary excitement of its writer.</p>

<p>Sleep, that night and morning, found and left Mr. Titmouse
the assured exulting master of <span class="smcap">Ten Thousand a-Year</span>.
Of this fact, the oftener he read Mr. Gammon's
letter, the stronger became his convictions. 'Twas undoubtedly
rather a large inference from small premises;
but it secured him unspeakable happiness, <i>for a time</i>, at
a possible cost of future disappointment and misery, which
he did not pause to consider. The fact is that logic (according
to Dr. Watts, but not according to Dr. Whateley,
<i>the right use of reason</i>) is not a practical art. No one regards
it in actual life; observe, therefore, folks on all
hands constantly acting like Tittlebat Titmouse in the
case before us. His <i>conclusion</i> was&mdash;that he had become
the certain master of ten thousand a-year; his <i>premises</i>
were&mdash;what the reader has seen. I do not, however,
mean to say, that if the reader be a youth hot from Oxford,
he may not be able to prove, by a very refined and
ingenious argument, that Titmouse was, in what he did
above, a fine natural logician; for I recollect that some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
great philosopher hath demonstrated, by a famous argument,
that there is <span class="smcap">nothing anywhere</span>: and no one that I
have heard of, hath ever been able to prove the contrary.</p>

<p>By six o'clock the next morning, Titmouse had, with
his own hand, dropped his answer into the letter-box upon
the door of Mr. Gammon's chambers in Thavies' Inn; in
which answer he had, with numerous expressions of profound
respect and gratitude, accepted Mr. Gammon's polite
invitation. A very happy man felt Titmouse as he
returned to Oxford Street; entering Messrs. Tag-rag's
premises with alacrity, just as they were being opened,
and volunteering his assistance in numerous things beyond
his usual province, with singular briskness and
energy; as if conscious that by doing so he was greatly
gratifying Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, whose
wishes upon the subject he knew. He displayed such
unwonted cheerfulness and patient good-nature throughout
the day, that one of his companions, a serious youth,
in a white neckerchief, black clothes, and with a blessed
countenance&mdash;the only professing pious person in the
establishment&mdash;took an occasion to ask him, in a mysterious
whisper, "whether he had not got <i>converted</i>:" and
whether he would, at six o'clock in the morning, accompany
the speaker to a room in the neighborhood, where
he (the youth aforesaid) was going to conduct an exhortation
and prayer meeting! Titmouse refused&mdash;but not
without a few qualms; for luck certainly seemed to be
smiling on him, and he felt that he ought to be grateful
for it; but then, he at length reflected, the proper place
for that sort of thing would be a regular <i>church</i>&mdash;to
which he accordingly resolved to go. This change of
manners Tag-rag, however, looked upon as assumed only
to affront <i>him</i>; seeing nothing but impertinence and
defiance in all that Titmouse did&mdash;as if the nearer
Titmouse got to the end of his bondage&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the 10th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of August&mdash;the lighter-hearted he grew! Titmouse
resolved religiously to keep his own counsel; to avoid
even&mdash;at all events for the present&mdash;communicating
with Huckaback.</p>

<p>On the ensuing Sunday he rose very early, and took
nearly twice as long a time as usual to dress&mdash;by reason
of his often falling into many delicious and momentarily
intoxicating reveries. By eleven o'clock he might have
been seen entering the gallery of St. Andrew's Church,
Holborn; where he considered that doubtless Mr. <ins title='Gamman'>Gammon</ins>,
who lived in the neighborhood, might have a seat.
He asked three or four pew-openers, both below and above
stairs, if they knew which was Mr. Gammon's pew&mdash;Mr.
Gammon of Thavies' Inn; not dreaming of presumptuously
going to the pew, but of sitting in some place which
commanded a view of it. Mr. Gammon, I need hardly
say, was quite unknown there&mdash;no one had ever heard
of such a person; nevertheless Titmouse, (albeit a little
galled at being, in spite of his elegant appearance, slipped
into a back seat in the gallery,) remained to the close of
the service&mdash;but his thoughts wandered grievously the
whole time. Having quitted the church in a buoyant
humor, he sauntered in the direction of Hyde Park. How
soon might he become, instead of a mere spectator as
heretofore, a partaker in its glories! The dawn of the
day of fortune was on his long-benighted soul; and he
could hardly subdue his excited feelings. Having eaten
nothing but a couple of biscuits during the day, as the
clock struck seven he made his punctual appearance at
Mr. Gammon's, with a pair of span-new white kid gloves
on; and somewhat flurried, was speedily ushered, by a
comfortable-looking elderly female servant, into Mr. Gammon's
room. Mr. Titmouse was dressed just as he had
been when first presented to the reader, sallying forth into
Oxford Street. Mr. Gammon, who was sitting reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the <i>Sunday Flash</i> at a table on which stood a couple of
decanters, several wine-glasses, and one or two dishes of
fruit, rose and received his distinguished visitor with the
most delightful affability.</p>

<p>"I am most happy, Mr. Titmouse, to see you in this
friendly way," said he, shaking him cordially by the hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't name it, sir!" quoth Titmouse, rather indistinctly,
and hastily running his hand through his hair.</p>

<p>"I've nothing, you see, to offer you but a little fruit
and a glass of fair port or sherry. You see I am a very
quiet man on Sundays!"</p>

<p>"Particular fond of <i>them</i>, sir," replied Titmouse, endeavoring
to clear his throat; for in spite of a strong
effort to appear at his ease, he was unsuccessful; so that,
when Gammon's keen eye glanced at the bedizened figure
of his guest, a bitter smile passed over his face, without
having been observed by Titmouse. "<i>This</i>," thought he,
as his eye passed from the ring glittering on the little
finger of the right hand, to the studs and breast-pin in
the shirt-front, and thence to the guard-chain glaring entirely
outside a damson-colored satin waistcoat, and the
spotless white glove which yet glistened on the left hand&mdash;"This
is the writer of the dismal epistle of the other
day, announcing his desperation and destitution!"</p>

<p>"Your health, Mr. Titmouse!&mdash;help yourself!" said
Mr. Gammon, in a cheerful and cordial tone; Titmouse
pouring out a glass only three-quarters full, raised it to
his lips with a slightly tremulous hand, and returned Mr.
Gammon's salutation. When had Titmouse tasted a glass
of wine before? a reflection occurring not only to himself,
but also to Gammon, to whom it was a circumstance that
might be serviceable.</p>

<p>"You see, Mr. Titmouse, mine's only a small bachelor's
establishment, and I cannot put my old servant out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
way by having my friends to dinner"&mdash;[quite forgetting
that the day before he had entertained at least six
friends, including Mr. Frankpledge&mdash;but, the idea of going
through a dinner <i>with Mr. Titmouse</i>!]</p>

<p>And now, O inexperienced Titmouse! unacquainted with
the potent qualities of wine, I warn you to be cautious
how you drink many glasses, for you cannot calculate the
effect which they will have upon you; and, indeed, methinks
that with this man you have a game to play which
will not admit of much wine being drunk. Be you, therefore,
on your guard; for wine is like a strong serpent, who
will creep unperceivedly into your empty head, and coil
himself up therein, until at length he begins to move
about&mdash;and all things are as nought to you!</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, 'pon my honor, beg you won't name it&mdash;all
one to me, sir!&mdash;Beautiful wine this, sir."</p>

<p>"Pretty fair, I think&mdash;certainly rather old;&mdash;but what
fruit will you take&mdash;raspberries or cherries?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;a&mdash;I've so lately dined," replied Titmouse,
alluding to the brace of biscuits on which he had luxuriated
several hours before. He would have preferred the
cherries, but did not feel quite at his ease how to dispose
of the <i>stones</i> nicely&mdash;gracefully&mdash;so he took a very few
raspberries upon his plate, and ate them slowly, and with
a modest and timid air.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Titmouse," commenced Gammon, with an
air of concern, "I was really much distressed by your last letter!"</p>

<p>"Uncommon glad to hear it, sir&mdash;knew you would, sir&mdash;you're
so kind-hearted;&mdash;all quite true, sir!"</p>

<p>"I had no idea that you were reduced to such straits,"
said Gammon, in a sympathizing tone, but settling his eye
involuntarily on the ring of Titmouse.</p>

<p>"Quite dreadful, sir&mdash;'pon my soul, dreadful; and
such usage at Mr. Tag-rag's!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you mustn't think of going abroad&mdash;away from
all your friends, Mr. Titmouse."</p>

<p>"<i>Abroad</i>, sir!" interrupted Titmouse, with anxious but
subdued eagerness; "never thought of such a thing!"</p>

<p>"Oh! I&mdash;I thought"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"There isn't a word of truth in it, sir; and if you've
heard so, it must have been from that oudacious fellow
that called on you&mdash;he's <i>such</i> a liar&mdash;if you knew him
as well as I do, sir!" said Titmouse, with a confident air,
quite losing sight of his piteous letter to Messrs. Quirk,
Gammon, and Snap&mdash;"No, sir&mdash;shall stay, and stick to
friends that stick to me."</p>

<p>"Take another glass of wine, Mr. Titmouse," interrupted
Gammon, cordially, and Titmouse obeyed him; but while
he was pouring it out, a sudden recollection of his letter
flashing across his mind, satisfied him that he stood detected
in a flat lie before Mr. Gammon, and he blushed scarlet.</p>

<p>"Do you like the sherry?" inquired Gammon, perfectly
aware of what was passing through the little mind of
his guest, and wishing to divert his thoughts. Titmouse
answered in the affirmative: and proceeded to pour forth
such a number of apologies for his own behavior at Saffron
Hill, and that of Huckaback on the subsequent occasion,
as Gammon found it difficult to stop, over and
over again assuring him that all had been entirely forgiven
and even forgotten. When Titmouse came to the
remittance of the five pounds&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't mention it, my dear sir," interrupted Gammon,
very blandly; "it gave me, I assure you, far greater satisfaction
to send it, than you to receive it. I hope it has
a little relieved you?"</p>

<p>"I think so, sir! I was, 'pon my life, on my very last legs."</p>

<p>"When things come to the worst, they often mend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Mr. Titmouse! I told Mr. Quirk (who, to do him justice,
came at last into my views) that, however premature,
and perhaps imprudent it might be in us to go so
far, I could not help relieving your present necessities,
even out of my own resources."</p>

<p>[Oh, Gammon, Gammon!]</p>

<p>"How very uncommon kind of you, sir!" exclaimed Titmouse.</p>

<p>"Not in the least, my dear sir&mdash;(pray fill another
glass, Mr. Titmouse!) You see Mr. Quirk is quite a
man of business&mdash;and our profession too often affords
instances of persons whose hearts contract as their purses
expand, Mr. Titmouse&mdash;ha! ha! Indeed, those who
make their money as hard as Mr. Quirk, are apt to be
slow at parting with it, and <i>very</i> suspicious!"</p>

<p>"Well, I hope no offence, sir; but really I thought
as much, directly I saw that old gent."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;but <i>now</i> he is embarked, heart and soul, in
the affair."</p>

<p>"No! <i>Is</i> he really, sir?" inquired Titmouse, eagerly.</p>

<p>"That is," replied Gammon, quickly, "so long as I am
at his elbow, urging him on&mdash;for he wants some one
who&mdash;hem! In fact, my dear sir, ever since I had the
good fortune to make the discovery, which happily brought
us acquainted with each other, Mr. Titmouse," [it was
old Quirk, as the reader will by and by find, who had
made the discovery, and Gammon had for a long time
thrown cold water on it,] "I have been doing all I could
with him, and I trust I may say, have at last got the
thing into shape."</p>

<p>"I'll take my oath, sir," said Titmouse, excitedly, "I
never was so much struck with any one in all my born
days as I was with you, sir, when you first came to my
emp&mdash;to Mr. Tag-rag's, sir&mdash;Lord, sir, how uncommon
sharp you seemed!" Gammon smiled with a deprecating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
air, and sipped his wine in silence; but there was great
sweetness in the expression of his countenance. Poor
Titmouse's doubts, hopes, and fears, were rapidly being
sublimed into a <i>reverence</i> for Gammon....</p>

<p>"I certainly quite agree with Mr. Quirk," said Gammon,
presently, "that the difficulties in our way are of
the most serious description. To speak, for an instant
only, of the risks we ourselves incur personally&mdash;would
you believe it, my dear Mr. Titmouse?&mdash;in such a disgraceful
state are our laws, that we can't gratify our feelings
by taking up your cause, without rendering ourselves
liable to imprisonment for Heaven knows how long, and
a fine that would be ruin itself, if we should be found out!"</p>

<p>Titmouse continued silent, his wine-glass in his hand
arrested in its way to his mouth; which, together with
his eyes, was opened to its widest extent, as he stared
with a kind of terror upon Mr. Gammon.&mdash;"<i>Are</i> we,
then, unreasonable, my dear sir, in entreating you to be
cautious&mdash;nay, in insisting on your compliance with our
wishes, in all that we shall deem prudent and necessary,
when not only your own best interests, but our characters,
liberties, and fortunes are staked on the issue of
this great enterprise? I am sure," continued Gammon,
with great emotion, "you will feel for us, Mr. Titmouse.
I see you do!" Gammon put his hand over his eyes, in
order, apparently, to conceal his emotion, but really to
observe what effect he had produced upon Titmouse.
The conjoint influence of Gammon's wine and eloquence
not a little agitated Titmouse, in whose eyes stood tears.</p>

<p>"I'll do anything&mdash;anything, sir," Titmouse almost sobbed.</p>

<p>"Oh! all we wish is to be allowed to serve you effectually;
and to enable us to do that"&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell me to get into a soot-bag, and lie hid in a coal-hole,
and see if I won't do it!"</p>

<p>"What! a coal-hole? Would you, then, even stop at
Tag-rag and Co.'s?"</p>

<p>"Ye-e-e-e-s, sir&mdash;hem! hem! That is, till the <i>tenth</i>
of next month, when my time's up."</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;ay!&mdash;oh, I understand! Another glass, Mr.
Titmouse," said Gammon, pouring himself out some more
wine; and observing, while Titmouse followed his example,
that there was an unsteadiness in his motions of a
very different description from that which he had exhibited
at the commencement of the evening&mdash;at the same
time wondering what the deuce they should do with him
after the <i>tenth</i> of August.</p>

<p>"You see, <i>I</i> have the utmost confidence in you, and
had so from the first happy moment when we met; but
Mr. Quirk is rather sus&mdash;In short to prevent misunderstanding
(as he says,) Mr. Quirk is anxious that you
should give a <i>written</i> promise." (Titmouse looked eagerly
about for writing materials.) "No, not now, but in a day
or two's time. I confess, my dear Mr. Titmouse, if <i>I</i>
might have decided on the matter, I should have been
satisfied with your verbal promise; but I must say, Mr.
Quirk's gray hairs seem to have made him quite&mdash;eh!
you understand? Don't you think so, Mr. Titmouse?"</p>

<p>"To be sure! 'pon my honor, Mr. Gammon!" replied
Titmouse; not very distinctly understanding, however,
what he was so energetically assenting to.</p>

<p>"I dare say you wonder why we wish you to stop
a few months longer at your present hiding-place at Tag-rag's?"</p>

<p>"<i>Can't</i>, possibly!&mdash;after the tenth of next month, sir,"
replied Titmouse, eagerly.</p>

<p>"But as soon as we begin to fire off our guns against
the enemy&mdash;Lord, my dear sir, if they could only find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
out, you know, where to get at you&mdash;you would never
live to enjoy your ten thousand a-year! They'd either
poison or kidnap you&mdash;get you out of the way, unless
you keep out of <i>their</i> way: and if you will but consent to
keep snug at Tag-rag's for a while, who'd suspect where
you was? We could easily arrange with your friend Tag-rag
that you should"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"My stars! I'd give something to hear you tell Tag-rag&mdash;why,
I wonder what he'll do!"</p>

<p>"Make you very comfortable, and let you have your
own way in everything&mdash;that you may rely upon!"</p>

<p>"Go to the play, for instance, whenever I want, and
do all that sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"Nay, try! anything! And as for money, I've persuaded
Mr. Quirk to consent to our advancing you a certain
sum per week, from the present time, while the cause
is going on,"&mdash;(Titmouse's heart began to beat fast,)&mdash;"in
order to place you above absolute inconvenience; and
when you consider the awful sums we shall have to disburse&mdash;cash
out of pocket&mdash;(the tongues of counsel, you
know, are set on gold springs, and only gold keys open
their lips!)&mdash;for court-fees, and a thousand other indispensable
matters, I should candidly say that four thousand
pounds of hard cash out of pocket, advanced by our
firm in your case, would be the very lowest." (Titmouse
stared at him with an expression of stupid wonder.) "Yes&mdash;four
thousand pounds, Mr. Titmouse, at the very least&mdash;the
<i>very</i> least." Again he paused, keenly scrutinizing
Titmouse's features by the light of the candles, which
just then were brought in. "You seem surprised, Mr. Titmouse."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;where's all the money to come from,
sir?" exclaimed Titmouse, aghast.</p>

<p>"Ah! that is indeed a fearful question,"&mdash;replied
Gammon, with a very serious air; "but at my request,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
our firm has agreed to make the necessary advances; and
also (for <i>I</i> could not bear the sight of your distress, Mr.
Titmouse!) to supply your necessities liberally in the
mean time, as I was saying."</p>

<p>"Won't you take another glass of wine, Mr. Gammon?"
suddenly inquired Titmouse, with a confident air.</p>

<p>"With all my heart, Mr. Titmouse! I'm delighted that
you approve of it. I paid enough for it, I can warrant you."</p>

<p>"Cuss me if ever I tasted such wine! Uncommon!
Come&mdash;no heel-taps, Mr. Gammon&mdash;here goes&mdash;let's
drink&mdash;success to the affair!"</p>

<p>"With all my heart, my dear sir&mdash;with all my heart.
Success to the thing&mdash;amen!" and Gammon drained
his glass; so did Titmouse. "Ah! Mr. Titmouse, you'll
soon have wine enough to float a frigate&mdash;and indeed
what not&mdash;with ten thousand a-year?"</p>

<p>"And all the back-rents, you know&mdash;ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;to be sure!&mdash;the back-rents! The sweetest
estate that is to be found in all Yorkshire! Gracious,
Mr. Titmouse!" continued Gammon, with an excited air&mdash;"What
may you not do? Go where you like&mdash;do
what you like&mdash;get into Parliament&mdash;marry some lovely
woman of high rank!"</p>

<p>"Lord, Mr. Gammon!&mdash;you a'n't dreaming? Nor I?
But now, in course, <i>you</i> must be paid handsome for your
trouble!&mdash;Only say how much&mdash;Name your sum! What
you please! You only get me all you've said&mdash;and I'll"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"For my part, I wish to rely entirely on your mere
word of honor. Between gentlemen, you know&mdash;my
dear sir"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You only try me, sir."</p>

<p>"But you see, Mr. Quirk's getting old, and naturally is
anxious to provide for those whom he will leave behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
him&mdash;and so Mr. Snap agreed with him&mdash;two to one
against me, Mr. Titmouse&mdash;of course they carried the
day&mdash;two to one."</p>

<p>"Never mind that!&mdash;only say the figure, sir!" cried
Titmouse, eagerly.</p>

<p>"A single year's income, only&mdash;ten thousand pounds
will hardly"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ten thousand pounds! By jingo, but that <i>is</i> a slice
out of the cake! Oh, Lord!" quoth Titmouse, looking aghast.</p>

<p>"A mere crumb, my dear sir!&mdash;a trifle! Why, <i>we</i>
are going to give <i>you</i> that sum at least every year&mdash;and
indeed it was suggested to our firm, that unless you gave
us at least a sum of twenty-five thousand pounds&mdash;in
fact, we were recommended to look out for some other heir."</p>

<p>"Oh dear! oh Mr. Gammon," cried Titmouse, hastily&mdash;"it's
not to be thought of, sir."</p>

<p>"So I said; and as for throwing it up&mdash;to be sure we
shall have ourselves to borrow large sums to carry on the
war&mdash;and unless we have your bond for at least ten
thousand pounds, we cannot raise a farthing."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;curse me, if you sha'n't do what you
like!&mdash;Give me your hand, and do what you like, Mr. Gammon!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Titmouse! How I like a glass of
wine with a friend in this quiet way!&mdash;you'll always
find me rejoiced to show"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your hand! By George&mdash;Didn't I take a liking to
you from the first? But to speak my mind a bit&mdash;as
for Mr. Quirk&mdash;excuse me&mdash;but he's a
cur&mdash;cur&mdash;cur&mdash;mudg&mdash;mudg&mdash;mudg&mdash;eon&mdash;hem!"</p>

<p>"Hope you've not been so imprudent, my dear Titmouse,"
threw in Mr. Gammon, rather anxiously, "as to
borrow money&mdash;eh?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Devil knows, and devil cares! No stamp, I know&mdash;bang
up to the mark"&mdash;here he winked an eye, and put
his finger to his nose&mdash;"wide awake&mdash;Huck&mdash;uck&mdash;uck&mdash;uck!
how his name sti&mdash;sticks. Your hand, Mr.
Gammon&mdash;here&mdash;this, this way&mdash;what are you bobbing
your head about for? Ah, ha!&mdash;The floor&mdash;'pon
my life!&mdash;how funny&mdash;it's like being at sea&mdash;up, down&mdash;oh
dear!"&mdash;he clapped his hand to his head.</p>

<p>[Pythagoras has finely observed, that a man is not to
be considered dead drunk till he lies on the floor, and
stretches out his arms and legs to prevent his going lower.]</p>

<p>See-saw, see-saw, up and down, up and down, went everything
about him. Now he felt sinking through the floor,
then gently rising towards the ceiling. Mr. Gammon
seemed getting into a mist, and waving about the candles
in it. Mr. Titmouse's head swam; his chair seemed to
be resting on the waves of the sea.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the room's rather close, Mr. Titmouse,"
hastily observed Gammon, perceiving from Titmouse's
sudden paleness and silence, but too evident symptoms
that his powerful intellect was for a while paralyzed.
Gammon started to the window and opened it. Paler,
however, and paler became Titmouse. Gammon's game
was up much sooner than he had calculated on.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Brown! Mrs. Brown!" he called out, opening
the sitting-room door&mdash;"order a coach instantly, and tell
Tomkins"&mdash;that was the inn porter&mdash;"to get his son
ready to go home with this gentleman&mdash;he's not very
well." He was quickly obeyed. It was, in truth, "<i>all up</i>"
with Titmouse&mdash;at least for a while.</p>

<p>As soon as Gammon had thus got rid of his distinguished
guest, he ordered the table to be cleared of the
glasses, and tea to be ready within half an hour. He
then walked out to enjoy the cool evening; on returning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
sat pleasantly sipping his tea, now and then dipping into
the edifying columns of the <i>Sunday Flash</i>, but oftener
ruminating upon his recent conversation with Titmouse,
and speculating upon certain possible results to himself
personally; and a little after eleven o'clock, that good
man, at peace with all the world&mdash;calm and serene&mdash;retired
to repose. He had that night rather a singular
dream; it was of a snake encircling a monkey, as if in
gentle and playful embrace. Suddenly tightening its
folds, a crackling sound was heard; the writhing coils
were then slowly unwound&mdash;and, with a shudder, he
beheld the monster licking over the motionless figure, till
it was covered with a viscid slime. Then the serpent
began to devour his prey; and, when gorged and helpless,
behold, it was immediately fallen upon by two other
snakes. To his disturbed fancy, there was a dim resemblance
between their heads and those of Quirk and Snap&mdash;they
all three became intertwisted together&mdash;and
writhed and struggled till they fell over the edge of a
dark and frightful precipice&mdash;he woke&mdash;thank God! it
was only a dream.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>When, after his return from Mr. Gammon's chambers, at
Thavies' Inn, Titmouse woke at an early hour in the
morning, he was laboring under the ordinary effects of
unaccustomed inebriety. His lips were perfectly parched;
his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth; there was a
horrid weight pressing on his aching eyes, and upon his
throbbing head. His pillow seemed undulating beneath
him, and everything swimming around him; but when,
to crown the whole, he was roused from a momentary nap
by the insupportable&mdash;the loathed importunities of Mrs.
Squallop, that he would just sit up and partake of three
thick rounds of hot buttered toast, and a great basin of
smoking tea, which would do him <i>so</i> much good, and
settle his stomach&mdash;at all events, if he'd only have a
thimbleful of gin in it&mdash;poor Titmouse was fairly overcome!...
He lay in bed all that day, during which
he underwent very severe sufferings; and it was not till
towards night that he began to have anything like a
distinct recollection of the events of the evening which he
had spent with Mr. Gammon; who, by the way, had sent
one of the clerks, during the afternoon, to inquire after
him. He did not get out of bed on the Tuesday till past
twelve o'clock, when, in a very rickety condition, he made
his appearance at the shop of Messrs. Tag-rag and Co.;
on approaching which he felt a sudden faintness, arising
from mingled apprehension and disgust.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, sir?&mdash;You're no longer in
my employment, sir," exclaimed Tag-rag, attempting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
speak calmly, as he hurried down the shop, white with
rage, to meet Titmouse, and planted himself right in the
way of his languid and pallid shopman.</p>

<p>"Sir!"&mdash;faintly exclaimed Titmouse, with his hat in
his hand.</p>

<p>"Very much obliged, sir&mdash;very! by the offer of your
valuable services," said Tag-rag. "But&mdash;<i>that's</i> the way
out again, sir&mdash;that!&mdash;there!&mdash;good-morning, sir&mdash;good-morning,
sir!&mdash;that's the way out"&mdash;and he
egged on Titmouse, till he had got him fairly into the
street&mdash;with infinite difficulty restraining himself from
giving the extruded sinner a parting kick! Titmouse
stood for a moment before the door, trembling and aghast,
looking in a bewildered manner at the shop: but Tag-rag
again making his appearance, Titmouse slowly walked
away and returned to his lodgings. Oh that Mr. Gammon
had witnessed the scene&mdash;thought he&mdash;and so have
been satisfied that it had been Tag-rag who had put an
end to his service, not he himself who had quitted it!</p>

<p>The next day, about the same hour, Mr. Gammon made
his appearance at the establishment from which Titmouse
had been expelled so summarily, and inquired for Mr.
Tag-rag, who presently presented himself&mdash;and recognizing
Mr. Gammon, whose presence naturally suggested the
previous day's transaction with Titmouse, changed color
a little.</p>

<p>"What did you please to want, sir?" inquired Mr.
Tag-rag, with a would-be resolute air, twirling round his
watch-key with some energy.</p>

<p>"Only a few minutes' conversation, sir, if you please,"
said Mr. Gammon, with such a significant manner as a
little disturbed Mr. Tag-rag; who, with an ill-supported
sneer, bowed very low, and led the way to his own little
room. Having closed the door, he, with an exceedingly
civil air, begged Mr. Gammon to be seated; and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
occupied the chair opposite to him, and awaited the issue
with ill-disguised anxiety.</p>

<p>"I am <i>very</i> sorry, Mr. Tag-rag," commenced Gammon,
in his usual elegant and feeling manner, "that any misunderstanding
should have arisen between you and Mr. Titmouse!"</p>

<p>"You're a lawyer, sir, I suppose?" Mr. Gammon bowed.
"Then you must know, sir, that there are always two sides
to a quarrel," said Mr. Tag-rag, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;you are right, Mr. Tag-rag; and, having already
heard Mr. Titmouse's version, may I be favored
with <i>your</i> account of your reasons for discharging him?
For he tells us that yesterday you dismissed him suddenly
from your employment, without giving him any warn"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"So I did, sir; and what of that?" inquired Tag-rag,
tossing his head with a sudden air of defiance. "Things
are come to a pretty pass indeed, when a man at the head
of such an establishment as mine, can't dismiss a drunken,
idle, impertinent&mdash;abusive vagabond." Here Mr. Gammon
somewhat significantly took out his tablets&mdash;as if
to note down the language of his companion.</p>

<p>"Do you seriously," inquired Mr. Gammon, "charge
him with being such a character, and can you <i>prove</i> your
charges, Mr. Tag-rag?"</p>

<p>"Prove 'em! yes, sir, a hundred times over; so will all
my young men!" replied Tag-rag, vehemently.</p>

<p>"And in a court of justice, Mr. Tag-rag?" said Mr.
Gammon, emphatically.</p>

<p>"Oh! he is going to <i>law</i>, is he? Ah, ha! Bless my
soul!&mdash;So <i>that's</i> why you're come here&mdash;ah, ha!&mdash;when
you can make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, you
may get your bill out of Mr. Tittlebat Titmouse!&mdash;ha,
ha, ha!" laughed Tag-rag, hoping thereby to conceal how
much he was really startled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well&mdash;that's <i>our</i> look-out, Mr. Tag-rag: to Mr.
Titmouse, his character is as valuable as Mr. Tag-rag's
is to him. In short, Mr. Titmouse has placed himself
in our hands, and we are resolved to go on with the
case, if it cost us a hundred pounds&mdash;we are indeed,
Mr. Tag-rag."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;he's not a penny in the world to go to law
with!" exclaimed Tag-rag, with an air of mingled wonder,
scorn, and alarm.</p>

<p>"But you forget, Mr. Tag-rag, that if Mr. Titmouse's
account of the business should turn out to be correct,
it will be <i>your</i> pocket that must pay all the expenses,
amounting probably to twenty times the sum which the
law may award to him!"</p>

<p>"<i>Law</i>, sir?&mdash;It's not justice!&mdash;I hate law.&mdash;Give
me common sense and common honesty!" said Mr. Tag-rag,
with a little agitation.</p>

<p>"Both of them would condemn your conduct, Mr. Tag-rag;
for I have heard a full account of what Mr. Titmouse
has suffered at your hands&mdash;of the cause of your
sudden warning to him, and your still more sudden dismissal
of yesterday. Oh, Mr. Tag-rag! upon my honor,
it won't do&mdash;not for a moment&mdash;and should you go on,
rely upon what I tell you, that it will cost you dear."</p>

<p>"And suppose, sir," said Tag-rag, in a would-be contemptuous
tone&mdash;"I should have witnesses to prove all
I've said&mdash;which of us will look funny <i>then</i>, sir?"</p>

<p>"Which, indeed! However, since that is your humor,
I can only assure you that it is very possible we may be,
by the time of the trial, possessed of some evidence which
will surprise you: and that Mr. Titmouse defies you to
prove any misconduct on his part. We have, in short,
taken up his cause, and, as you may perhaps find by and
by, to your cost, we shall not easily let it drop."</p>

<p>"I mean no offence, sir," said Tag-rag, in a mitigated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
tone; "but I must say, that ever since <i>you</i> first came
here, Titmouse has been quite another person. He seems
not to know who I am, nor to care either&mdash;and he's perfectly unbearable."</p>

<p>"My dear sir, what has he <i>said</i> or <i>done</i>?&mdash;that, you
know, is what you must be prepared to prove, when you
come into court!"</p>

<p>"Well, sir! and which of us is likely to be best off for
witnesses?&mdash;Think of that, sir&mdash;I've eighteen young men"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"We shall chance that, sir," replied Gammon, shrugging
his shoulders, and smiling very bitterly; "but again,
I ask, what did you dismiss him for? and, sir, I request
a plain, straightforward answer."</p>

<p>"What did I dismiss him for?&mdash;Haven't I eyes and
ears?&mdash;First and foremost, he's the most odious-mannered
fellow I ever came near&mdash;and&mdash;he hadn't a shirt
to his back when I first took him&mdash;the ungrateful wretch!&mdash;Sir,
it's at any rate not against the law, I suppose, to
<i>hate</i> a man;&mdash;and if it isn't, how I <span class="smcap">hate</span> Titmouse!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Tag-rag"&mdash;said Gammon, lowering his voice, and
looking very earnestly at his companion&mdash;"can I say a
word to you in confidence&mdash;the strictest confidence?"</p>

<p>"What's it about, sir?" inquired Tag-rag, somewhat apprehensively.</p>

<p>"I dare say you may have felt, perhaps, rather surprised
at the interest which I&mdash;in fact our office, the
office of Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, in Saffron Hill&mdash;appear
to have taken in Mr. Titmouse."</p>

<p>"Why, sir, it's <i>your</i> look-out to see how you're to
be paid for what you're doing&mdash;and I dare say lawyers
generally keep a pretty sharp look-out in that direction!"</p>

<p>Gammon smiled, and continued&mdash;"It may, perhaps,
a little surprise you, Mr. Tag-rag, to hear that your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
present (ought I to say, your <i>late</i>?) shopman, Mr. Tittlebat
Titmouse, is at this moment probably the very luckiest
man&mdash;and one among the richest, too&mdash;in this kingdom."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;you don't mean to say he's drawn a prize in
the lottery?"&mdash;exclaimed Tag-rag, pricking up his ears,
and manifestly changing color.</p>

<p>"Pho! my dear sir, <i>that</i> is a mere bagatelle compared
with the good fortune which has just fallen to his lot. I
solemnly assure you, that I believe it will very shortly
turn out that he is at this moment the undoubted owner
of an estate worth at least ten thousand a-year, besides a
vast accumulation of ready money!"</p>

<p>"Ten thousand a-year, sir!&mdash;My Titmouse!&mdash;Tittlebat
Titmouse!&mdash;Ten thousand a-year! it's quite impossible!"
faltered Tag-rag, after a pause, having gone as
pale as death.</p>

<p>"I have as little doubt of the fact, however, sir, as I
have that you yesterday turned him out of doors, Mr. Tag-rag!"</p>

<p>"But"&mdash;said Mr. Tag-rag, in a low tone&mdash;"who
could have dreamed it?&mdash;How was&mdash;<i>really</i>, Mr. Gammon!&mdash;how
<i>was</i> I to know it?"</p>

<p>"That's the fact, however," said Gammon, shrugging
his shoulders. Tag-rag wriggled about in his chair, put
his hands in and out of his pockets, scratched his head,
and continued staring open-mouthed at the bearer of
such astounding intelligence. "Perhaps, however, all
this is meant as a joke, sir,"&mdash;said he&mdash;"And if
so&mdash;it's&mdash;it's&mdash;a very"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's one of his solicitors who were fortunate enough
to make the discovery, that tells you, sir," interrupted
Gammon, calmly. "I repeat what I have already told
you, Mr. Tag-rag, that an estate of ten thousand a-year is
the very least"&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, that's two hundred thousand pounds, sir!"&mdash;exclaimed
Tag-rag, with an awe-struck air.</p>

<p>"At the very least"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lord, Mr. Gammon!&mdash;Excuse me, sir, but how <i>did</i>
you find it out?"</p>

<p>"Mere accident&mdash;a mere accidental discovery, sir, in
the course of other professional inquiries!"</p>

<p>"And does Mr. Titmouse know it?"</p>

<p>"Ever since the day, Mr. Tag-rag, after that on which
I called on him here!" replied Gammon, pointedly.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;don't&mdash;say&mdash;so!"&mdash;exclaimed Tag-rag,
and then continued silent for nearly half a minute, evidently
amazed beyond all power of expression.</p>

<p>"Well,"&mdash;at length he observed&mdash;"I <i>will</i> say this&mdash;with
all his few faults&mdash;he's the most amiable young
gentleman&mdash;the <i>very amiablest</i> young gentleman I&mdash;ever&mdash;came
near. I always thought there was something
uncommon superior-like in his looks."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I think he <i>is</i> of rather an amiable turn," observed
Gammon, with an expressive smile&mdash;"very gentlemanlike&mdash;and
so intelligent"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Intelligent! Mr. Gammon! you should only have
known him as I have known him!&mdash;Well, to be sure!&mdash;Lord!
His only fault was, that he was above his business;
but when one comes to think of it, how could it
be otherwise? From the time I first clapped eyes on
him&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;knew he was&mdash;a superior article&mdash;quite
superior&mdash;you know what I mean, sir?&mdash;he couldn't help
it, of course!&mdash;to be sure&mdash;he never was much liked by the
other young men; but that was jealousy!&mdash;all jealousy;
I saw that all the while." Here he looked at the door,
and added in a very low tone, "Many sleepless nights has
their bad treatment of Mr. Titmouse cost me!&mdash;Even I,
now and then, used to look and speak sharply to him&mdash;just
to keep him, as it were, down to the mark of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
others&mdash;he was so uncommon handsome and genteel in
his manner, sir. I remember telling my good lady the
very first day he came to me, that he was a gentleman
born&mdash;or ought to have been one."</p>

<p>Now, do you suppose, acute reader, that Mr. Tag-rag
was insincere in all this? By no means. He spoke the
real dictates of his heart, unaware of the sudden change
which had taken place in his feelings. It certainly has
an ugly look of improbability&mdash;but it was the <i>nature of
the beast</i>; his eye suddenly caught a glimpse of the golden
calf, and he instinctively fell down and worshipped it.
"Well&mdash;at all events," said Mr. Gammon, scarcely able
to keep a serious expression on his face&mdash;"though he's
not lived much like a gentleman hitherto, yet he will live
for the future like a <i>very great gentleman</i>&mdash;and spend his
money like one, too."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;dare say&mdash;- he will!&mdash;I wonder how he <i>will</i>
get through a quarter of it!&mdash;what do <i>you</i> think he'll
do, sir?"</p>

<p>"Heaven only knows&mdash;he may very shortly do just
what he likes! Go into the House of Commons,
or&mdash;perhaps&mdash;have a peerage given him"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lord, sir!&mdash;I feel as if I shouldn't be quite right
again for the rest of the day!&mdash;I own to you, sir, that
all yesterday and to-day I've been on the point of going
to Mr. Titmouse's lodgings to apologize for&mdash;for&mdash;&mdash; Good
gracious me! one can't take it all in at once&mdash;Ten
thousand a-year!&mdash;Many a lord hasn't got more&mdash;some
not half as much, I'll be bound!&mdash;Dear me, what will
he do!&mdash;Well, one thing I'm <i>sure</i> of&mdash;he'll never have
a truer friend than plain Thomas Tag-rag, though I've
not always been a-flattering him&mdash;I respected him too
much!&mdash;The many little things I've borne with in Titmouse,
that in any one else I'd have&mdash;But why didn't
he tell me, sir? We should have understood one another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
in a moment."&mdash;Here he paused abruptly; for his breath
seemed suddenly taken away, as he reviewed the series of
indignities which he had latterly inflicted on Titmouse&mdash;the
kind of life which that amiable young gentleman had
led in his establishment.</p>

<p>Never had the keen Gammon enjoyed anything more
exquisitely than the scene which I have been describing.
To a man of his practical sagacity in the affairs
of life, and knowledge of human nature, nothing could
appear more ludicrously contemptible than the conduct
of poor Tag-rag. How differently are the minds of men
constituted! How Gammon despised Tag-rag! And
what opinion has the acute reader by this time formed
of Gammon?</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i>, may I take for granted, Mr. Tag-rag, that we
understand each other?" inquired Gammon.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Tag-rag, meekly. "But do you
think Mr. Titmouse will ever forgive or forget the little
misunderstanding we've lately had? If I could but explain
to him how I have been acting a part towards him&mdash;all
for his good!"</p>

<p>"You may have opportunities for doing so, if you are
really so disposed, Mr. Tag-rag; for I have something seriously
to propose to you. Circumstances render it desirable
that for some little time this important affair should
be kept as quiet as possible; and it is Mr. Titmouse's
wish and ours&mdash;as his confidential professional advisers&mdash;that
for some few months he should continue in
your establishment, and apparently in your service as before."</p>

<p>"In my service!&mdash;my service!" interrupted Tag-rag,
opening his eyes to their utmost. "I sha'n't know how to
behave in my own premises! Have a man with ten thousand
a-year behind my counter, sir? I might as well have
the Lord Mayor! Sir, it can't&mdash;it can't be. Now, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Mr. Titmouse chose to become a <i>partner</i> in the house&mdash;ay,
there might be something in that&mdash;he needn't
have any trouble&mdash;be only a sleeping partner." Tag-rag
warmed with the thought. "Really, sir, that wouldn't
be so much amiss&mdash;would it?" Gammon assured him
that it was out of the question; and gave him some of
the reasons for the proposal which he (Mr. Gammon) had
been making. While Gammon fancied that Tag-rag was
paying profound attention to what he was saying, Tag-rag's
thoughts had shot far ahead. He had an only child&mdash;a
daughter, about twenty years old&mdash;Miss Tabitha Tag-rag;
and the delightful possibility of her by-and-by becoming
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Titmouse</span>, put her aspiring parent into a perspiration.
Into the proposal just made by Mr. Gammon, Tag-rag
fell with great eagerness, which he attempted to conceal&mdash;for
what innumerable opportunities would it not afford
him for bringing about the desire of his heart&mdash;for throwing
the lovely young couple into each other's way,&mdash;endearing
them to each other! Oh, delightful! It really
looked almost as if it had been determined by the powers
above that the thing should come to pass! If Mr. Titmouse
did not dine with him, Mrs. and Miss Tag-rag,
at Satin Lodge, Clapham, on the very next Sunday, it
should, Tag-rag resolved, be owing to no fault of <i>his</i>.&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Gammon having arranged everything exactly as he
had desired, and having again enjoined Mr. Tag-rag to
absolute secrecy, took his departure. Mr. Tag-rag, in his
excitement, thrust out his hand, and grasped that of Gammon,
which was extended towards him somewhat coldly
and reluctantly. Tag-rag attended him with extreme obsequiousness
to the door; and on his departure, walked back
rapidly to his own room, and sat down for nearly half an
hour in a sort of turbid but delicious revery. Abruptly
rising, at length, he clapped his hat on his head, and saying,
as he passed along the shop, that he should soon be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
back, hurried out to call upon his future son-in-law, full
of affectionate anxiety concerning his health&mdash;and vowing
within himself, that henceforth it should be the study
of his life to make his daughter and Titmouse happy!
There could be no doubt of the reality of the event just
communicated to him by Mr. Gammon; for he was one
of a well-known firm of solicitors; he had had an interview
on "important business" with Titmouse a fortnight
before, and that <i>could</i> have been nothing but the prodigious
event just communicated to himself. Such things
had happened to others&mdash;why not to Tittlebat Titmouse?
In short, Tag-rag had no doubt on the matter; and his
heart really yearned towards Titmouse.</p>

<p>Finding that gentleman not at home, Mr. Tag-rag left
a most particularly civil message, half a dozen times repeated,
with Mrs. Squallop (to whom also he was specially
civil,) to the effect that he, Mr. Tag-rag, would be
only too happy to see Mr. Titmouse at No. 375, Oxford
Street, whenever it might suit his convenience; that Mr.
Tag-rag had something very particular to say to him about
the unpleasant and <i>unaccountable</i>[!] occurrence of yesterday;
that Mr. Tag-rag was most deeply concerned to hear
of Mr. Titmouse's indisposition, and anxious to learn from
himself that he had recovered, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.;&mdash;all which,
together with one or two other little matters, which
Mrs. Squallop could not help putting together, satisfied
that shrewd lady that "something was in the wind about
Mr. Titmouse;" and made her reflect rather anxiously
on one or two violent scenes she had had with him, and
which <i>she</i> was now ready entirely to forget and forgive.
Having thus done all that at present was in his power
to forward the affair, the anxious and excited Tag-rag returned
to his shop; on entering which, one Lutestring, his
principal young man, eagerly apprised him of a claim which
he had, as he imagined, only the moment before, established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to the thanks of Mr. Tag-rag, by having "bundled
off, neck and crop, that hodious Titmouse," who, about
five minutes before, had, it seemed, had the "impudence"
to present himself at the shop-door, and walk in as if
nothing had happened!! [Titmouse had so presented
himself in consequence of a call from Mr. Gammon,
immediately after his interview with Tag-rag.]</p>

<p>"You&mdash;ordered&mdash;Mr. Titmouse&mdash;off!!" exclaimed
Tag-rag, starting back aghast, and almost petrifying his
voluble and officious assistant.</p>

<p>"Of course, sir," at length exclaimed that person,
meekly&mdash;"after what happened yester"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who authorized you, Mr. Lutestring?" inquired
Tag-rag, striving to choke down the rage rising within him.</p>

<p>"Why, sir, I <i>really</i> supposed that"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You supposed!! You're a meddling, impertinent,
disgusting"&mdash;&mdash; Suddenly his face was overspread with
smiles, as three or four elegantly dressed customers entered,
whom he received with profuse obeisances. But
when their backs were turned, he directed a lightning
look towards Lutestring, and retreated once more to his
room, to meditate on the agitating events of the last hour.
The extraordinary alteration in Mr. Tag-rag's behavior was
attributed by his shopmen to his having been frightened
out of his wits by the threats of Titmouse's lawyer&mdash;for
such it was clear the stranger was; and more than one of
them stored it up in their minds as a useful precedent
against some future occasion.</p>

<p>Twice afterwards during the day did Tag-rag call at Mr.
Titmouse's lodgings&mdash;but in vain; and on returning the
third time he felt not a little disquieted. He determined,
however, to call the first thing on the ensuing morning;
if he should then fail of seeing Mr. Titmouse, he was resolved
to go to Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
besides, address a very affectionate letter to Mr. Titmouse.
How totally changed had become all his feelings towards
that gentleman within the last few hours. The more that
Tag-rag reflected on Titmouse's conduct, the more he saw
in it to approve of. How steady and regular had he been
in his habits! how civil and obliging! how patient of rebuke!
how pleasing in his manners to the customers!
Surely, surely, thought Tag-rag, Titmouse can't have been
four long years in my employ without getting a&mdash;sort of
a&mdash;feeling&mdash;of attachment to me&mdash;he'd have left long
ago if he hadn't! It was true there <i>had</i> now and then
been tiffs between them; but who could agree always?
Even Mrs. Tag-rag and he, when they were courting, often
fell out with one another!&mdash;Tag-rag was now ready to
forget and forgive all&mdash;he had never meant any harm to
Titmouse. He believed that poor Tittlebat was an orphan,
unhappy soul! alone in the wide world&mdash;<i>now</i> he would
become the prey of designing strangers and adventurers.
Tag-rag did not like the appearance of Gammon. No
doubt that person would try and ingratiate himself as
much as possible with Titmouse! Then Titmouse was
remarkably good-looking. "I wonder what Tabby will
think of him when she sees him!" How anxious Tittlebat
must be to see her&mdash;<i>his</i> daughter! How could Tag-rag
make Tittlebat's stay at his premises (for he could not
bring himself to believe that on the morrow he could not
set all right, and disavow the abominable conduct of Lutestring)
agreeable and delightful? He would discharge the
first of his young men that did not show Titmouse proper
respect.&mdash;What low lodgings poor Tittlebat lived in!&mdash;Why
could he not take up his quarters at Satin Lodge?
They always had a nice spare bedroom. Ah! <i>that</i> would
be a stroke! How Tabby could endear herself to him!
What a number of things Mrs. Tag-rag could do to make
him comfortable!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>About seven o'clock Tag-rag quitted his premises in
Oxford Street, for his country house; and, occupied with
these and similar delightful and anxious thoughts and
speculations, hurried along Oxford Street on his way to
the Clapham stage, without thinking of his umbrella,
though it rained fast. When he had taken his place on
the coach-box, beside old Crack, (as he had done almost
every night for years,) he was so unusually silent that
Crack naturally thought his best passenger was going to
become bankrupt, or compound with his creditors, or do
something in that line, shortly. Mr. Tag-rag could hardly
keep his temper at the slow pace old Crack was driving at&mdash;just
when Mr. Tag-rag would have wished to gallop the
whole way. Never had he descended with so much briskness,
as when the coach at length drew up before the little
green gate, which opened on the tidy little gravel
walk, which led up to the little green wooden porch,
which sheltered the little door which admitted you into
little Satin Lodge. As Tag-rag stood for a moment wiping
his wet shoes upon the mat, he could not help observing,
for the first time, by the inward light of ten thousand
a-year, how <i>uncommon</i> narrow the passage was; and thinking
that Satin Lodge would never <i>do</i>, when he should be
the father-in-law of a man worth ten thousand a-year&mdash;but
he could easily let that house then, and take a large
one. As he hung his hat upon the peg, the perilous insolence
of Lutestring occurred to him; and he deposited
such a prodigious, but half-suppressed execration upon
that gentleman's name, as must have sunk a far more
buoyant sinner many fathoms deeper than usual into a
certain hot and deep place that shall be nameless.</p>

<p>Mrs. and Miss Tag-rag were sitting in the front parlor,
intending to take tea as soon as Mr. Tag-rag should have
arrived. It was not a large room, but sweetly furnished,
according to the taste of the owners. There was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
one window, and it had a flaunting white summer curtain.
The walls were ornamented with three pictures, in
ponderous gilt frames, being portraits of Mr., Mrs., and
Miss Tag-rag; and I do not feel disposed to say more concerning
these pictures, than that in each of them the <i>dress</i>
was done with elaborate exactness&mdash;the <i>faces</i> seeming to
have been painted in, for the purpose of setting off and
completing the picture of the dress. The skinny little
Miss Tag-rag sat at the worn-out, jingling pianoforte, causing
it to utter&mdash;oh, horrid and doleful sound!&mdash;"<i>The
Battle of Prague</i>." Mrs. Tag-rag, a fat, showily dressed
woman of about fifty, her cap having a prodigious number
of artificial flowers in it, sat reading a profitable volume, entitled
"<i>Groans from the Bottomless Pit to Awaken Sleeping
Sinners</i>," by (as he was pleased to dignify himself) <i>the
Rev.</i> <span class="smcap">Dismal Horror</span>&mdash;a very rousing young dissenting
preacher lately come into that neighborhood, and who
had almost frightened into fits half the women and children,
and one or two old men, of his congregation; giving
out, among several similarly cheering intimations, that
they must all necessarily be damned unless they immediately
set about making themselves as miserable as <ins title='possisible'>possible</ins>
in this world. Only the Sunday before, he had
pointed out, with awful force and distinctness, how cards
and novels were the devil's traps to catch souls; and balls
and theatres short and easy cuts to&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>He had proved to his trembling female hearers, in effect,
that there was only one way to heaven, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> through
his chapel; that the only safe mode of spending their
time on earth was reading such blessed works as that
which he had just published, and going daily to prayer-meetings.
When, however, a Sunday or two before, he
had the assurance to preach a funeral sermon, to "improve
the death"&mdash;such being his impressive phrase&mdash;of
a Miss Snooks, (who had kept a circulating library in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the neighborhood, but had not been a member of his congregation;)
and who, having been to the theatre on the
Thursday night, was taken ill of a bowel attack on the
Friday, and was a "<i>lifeless corpse</i> when the next Sabbath
dawned"&mdash;you might have heard a beetle sneeze within
any of the walls, all over the crowded chapel. Two-thirds
of the women present, struck with the awful judgment
upon the deceased Miss Snooks, inwardly made solemn
vows never again to enter the accursed walls of a theatre
or concert-room;[<a href='#Note_11'>11</a>] many determined no longer to subscribe
to the circulating library, ruining their precious
souls with light and amusing reading; and almost all resolved
forthwith to become active members of a sort of
religious tract society, which "dear Mr. Horror" had just
established in the neighborhood, for the purpose of giving
the sick and starving poor <i>spiritual</i> food, in the shape of
tracts, (chiefly written by himself,) which might "wean
their affections away from this vain world," and "fix them
on better things," rejoicing, in the meanwhile, in the bitter
pangs of destitution&mdash;and able to bear them! All
this sort of thing Mr. Horror possibly imagined to be
calculated to advance the cause of real religion! In short,
he had created a sort of spiritual fever about the place
which was then just at its height in worthy Mrs. Tag-rag.</p>

<p>"Well, Dolly, how are you to-night?" inquired Tag-rag,
with unusual briskness, on entering the room.</p>

<p>"Tolerable, thank you, Tag," replied Mrs. Tag-rag,
mournfully, with a sigh, closing the cheerful volume she
had been perusing&mdash;it having been recommended the preceding
Sunday from the pulpit by its pious and gifted
author, to be read and prayed over every day by every
member of his congregation!</p>

<p>"And how are <i>you</i>, Tabby?" said Tag-rag, addressing
his daughter. "Come and kiss me, you little slut&mdash;come!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I sha'n't, pa! Do let me go on with my practising,"
said Miss Tag-rag&mdash;and twang! twang! went those
infernal keys.</p>

<p>"D'&nbsp;ye hear, Tab? Come and kiss me, you little minx"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Really, pa, how provoking&mdash;just as I am in the
middle of the <i>Cries of the Wounded</i>! I sha'n't&mdash;that's flat."</p>

<p>The doting parent could not, however, be denied; so
he stepped to the piano, put his arm around his dutiful
daughter's neck, kissed her fondly, and then stood for a
moment behind her, admiring her brilliant execution of
The <i>Trumpet of Victory</i>. Having changed his coat, and
put on an old pair of shoes, Mr. Tag-rag was comfortable
for the evening.</p>

<p>"Tabby plays wonderful well, Dolly, don't she?" said
Tag-rag, as the tea-things were being brought in, by way
of beginning a conversation, while he drew his chair nearer
to his wife.</p>

<p>"Ah! I'd a deal rather see her reading something
serious&mdash;for life is short, Tag, and eternity's long."</p>

<p>"Botheration!&mdash;Stuff!&mdash;Tut!" exclaimed Tag-rag!</p>

<p>"You may find it out one day, my dear, when, alas!
it's too late"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, Dolly," said Tag-rag, angrily,
"you're doing a great deal too much in this line of business&mdash;my
house is getting like a Methodist meeting-house.
I can't bear it&mdash;I can't! What the deuce is
come to you all in these parts, lately?" Mr. Tag-rag, I
should apprise the reader, had been induced, some three
years before, to quit the Church of England and take up
with Mr. Dismal Horror; but his zeal had by no means
kept pace with that of his wife.</p>

<p>"Ah, Tag-rag," replied his wife, with a sigh, "I can
only pray for you&mdash;I can do no more"&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Tag-rag, with an air of desperate
disgust, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and stretching
his legs to their utmost extent under the table. "I'll
tell you what, Mrs. T." he added after a while, "I like
religion well enough&mdash;but too much of it no one can
stand. Too much of one thing is good for nothing; you
may choke a dog with pudding;&mdash;I sha'n't renew my
sittings at Mr. Horror's."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, dear pa, do! That's a love of a pa!" interposed
Miss Tag-rag, twirling round on her music-stool.
"All Clapham's running after him&mdash;he's quite the rage!
There's the Dugginses, the Pips, the Jones, the Maggots,&mdash;and,
really, Mr. Horror does preach such dreadful
things, it's quite delightful to look round and see all the
people with their eyes and mouths wide open&mdash;and ours
is such a good pew for seeing&mdash;and Mr. Horror is such
a bee&mdash;yeautiful preacher&mdash;isn't he, ma?"</p>

<p>"Yes, love, he is&mdash;but I wish I could see you profit
by him, and preparing for death"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, ma, how <i>can</i> you go on in that ridiculous way?
You know I'm not twenty yet, however old you and pa
may be!"</p>

<p>"Well, well! poor Tabby!" here Mrs. Tag-rag's voice
faltered&mdash;"a day will come, when"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Play me the <i>Devil among the Tailors</i>, or <i>Copenhagen
Waltz</i>, or something of that sort, Tabby," said her father,
furiously, "or I shall be sick!&mdash;I can't bear it! Curse Mr. Hor"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well!&mdash;Oh, my!!&mdash;I never!&mdash;Mr. Tag-rag!" exclaimed
his astounded wife.</p>

<p>"Play away, Tab, or I'll go and sit in the kitchen!
They're cheerful <i>there</i>! The next time I come across
Mr. Horror, if I don't give him a bit of my mind"&mdash;here
he paused, and slapped his hand with much energy upon
the table. Mrs. Tag-rag wiped her eyes, sighed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
resumed her book. Miss Tag-rag began to make tea, her
papa gradually forgetting his rage, as he fixed his dull
gray eyes fondly on the pert skinny countenance of his daughter.</p>

<p>"By the way, Tag," exclaimed Mrs. Tag-rag, suddenly,
but in the same mournful tone, addressing her husband,
"you haven't of course forgot the flowers for my new bonnet?"</p>

<p>"Never once thought of it," replied Tag-rag, doggedly.</p>

<p>"You haven't! Good gracious! what am I to go to
chapel in next Sunday?" she exclaimed with sudden
alarm, closing her book, "and our seat in the very front
of the gallery!&mdash;bless me! I shall have a hundred eyes
on me!"</p>

<p>"Now that you're coming down a bit, and dropped out
of the clouds&mdash;or p'r'aps I should say&mdash;come up from
beneath!&mdash;Dolly," said her husband, much relieved,
"I'll tell you a bit of news that will, I fancy, rather"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come! what is it, Tag?" she inquired with a sort of
languid curiosity.</p>

<p>"What should you say of a chance of a certain somebody"
(here he looked unutterable things at his daughter)
"that shall be nameless, becoming mistress of ten thousand a-year?"</p>

<p>"Why"&mdash;Mrs. Tag-rag changed color&mdash;"has any one
fallen in love with Tab?"</p>

<p>"What should you say, Mrs. T., of our Tab marrying a
man with ten thousand a-year? There's for you! Isn't
<i>that</i> better than all your rel&mdash;&mdash; hem!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Tag, don't say that; but"&mdash;here she hastily
turned down the leaf of <i>Groans from the Bottomless Pit</i>,
and tossed that inestimable work upon the sofa&mdash;"do
tell me, lovey! what <i>are</i> you talking about?"</p>

<p>"What indeed, Dolly!&mdash;I'm going to have him here
to dinner next Sunday."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Tag-rag having been listening with breathless
eagerness to this little colloquy between her prudent and
amiable parents, unconscious of what she was about,
poured almost all the contents of the tea-pot into the
sugar-basin, instead of her papa's and mamma's tea-cups.</p>

<p>"Have <i>who</i>, dear Tag?" inquired Mrs. Tag-rag, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Who? why whom but my Tittlebat Titmouse!!
You've seen him, and heard me speak of him often,
you know"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What!&mdash;<i>that</i> odious, nasty"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hush, hush!" involuntarily exclaimed Tag-rag, with
an apprehensive air&mdash;"That's all past and gone&mdash;I was
always a little too hard on him. Well, anyhow, he's
turned up all of a sudden master of ten thousand a-year.
He has indeed&mdash;may this piece of toast choke me if
he hasn't!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Tag-rag and her daughter sat in speechless wonder.</p>

<p>"Where did he see Tab, Taggy?" inquired at length
Mrs. Tag-rag.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;why&mdash;you see&mdash;I don't exactly
think <i>that</i> signifies so much&mdash;he <i>will</i> see her, you know,
next Sunday."</p>

<p>"So, then, he's positively coming?" inquired Mrs. Tag-rag,
with a fluttered air.</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;e&mdash;s&mdash;I've no doubt."&mdash;(I'll discharge Lutestring
to-morrow, thought Tag-rag, with a sharp inward spasm.)</p>

<p>"But aren't we counting our chickens, Taggy, before
they're hatched? If Titmouse is all of a sudden become
such a catch, he'll be snapped up in a minute, you know,
of course"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, you see, Dolly&mdash;we're first in the market,
I'm sure of that&mdash;his attorney tells me he's to be kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
quite snug and quiet under my care for months, and see
no one"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"My gracious!" exclaimed Mrs. Tag-rag, holding up
both her hands&mdash;"if <i>that</i> don't look like a special interposition
of Providence, now"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"So <i>I</i> thought, Tabby, while Mr. Gammon was telling
me!" replied her husband.</p>

<p>"Ah, Tag, there are many of 'em, if we were only to be
on the look-out for them!" said Mrs. Tag-rag, excitedly.</p>

<p>"I <i>do</i> see it all! It's designed by Providence to get
them soon together! When once Mr. Titmouse gets
sight of Tabby, and gets into her company&mdash;eh! Tab,
lovey! <i>you'll</i> do the rest, hem!" said Tag-rag, fondly.</p>

<p>"La, pa! how you <i>do</i> go on!" simpered Miss Tag-rag.</p>

<p>"You must do your part, Tab," said her father&mdash;"we'll
do ours. He'll bite, you may depend on it, if you
manage well!"</p>

<p>"What sort of a looking young man is he, dear pa?"
inquired Miss Tag-rag, blushing, and her heart fluttering
very fast.</p>

<p>"Oh, you <i>must</i> have seen him, sweetest"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"How should I ever notice any one of the lots of young
men at the shop, pa?&mdash;I don't at all know him."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;he's the handsomest, most genteel-looking
young fellow I ever came across; he's long been an
ornament to my establishment, for his good looks and
civil and obliging manners&mdash;quite a treasure! You
should have seen how he <i>took</i> with the ladies of rank always!"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear me," interrupted Mrs. Tag-rag, anxiously addressing
her daughter, "I hope, Tabby, that Miss Nix
will send home your lilac-colored frock by next Sunday!"</p>

<p>"If she <i>don't</i>, ma, I'll take care she never makes anything
more for <i>me</i>, that's poz!" replied Miss Tag-rag, earnestly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll call there to-morrow, love, and hurry her on,"
said her mother; and from that moment until eleven
o'clock, when the amiable and interesting trio retired to
rest, nothing was talked of but the charming Titmouse,
and the good fortune he so richly deserved, and how long
the courtship was likely to last. Mrs. Tag-rag, who, for
the last month or so, had always remained on her knees
before getting into bed, for at least ten minutes, on this
eventful evening compressed her prayers, I regret to say,
into one minute and a half's time, (as for Tag-rag, a hardened
heathen, for all he had taken to hearing Mr. Horror,
he always tumbled prayerless into bed, the moment he
was undressed;) while, for once in a way, Miss Tag-rag,
having taken only five minutes to put her hair into papers,
popped into bed directly she had blown the candle
out, without saying <i>any</i> prayers&mdash;or even thinking of
finishing the novel which lay under her pillow, and which
she had got on the sly from the circulating library of the
late Miss Snooks. For several hours she lay in a delicious
revery, imagining herself become Mrs. Tittlebat
Titmouse, riding about Clapham in a handsome carriage,
going to the play every night; and what would the three
Miss Knippses say when they heard of it?&mdash;they'd burst.
And such a handsome man, too!</p>

<p>She sank, at length, into unconsciousness, amid a soft
confusion of glistening white satin&mdash;favors&mdash;bridesmaids&mdash;Mrs.
Tittlebat Tit&mdash;Tit&mdash;Tit&mdash;Tit&mdash;mouse.</p>

<p>Titmouse, about half-past nine o'clock on the ensuing
morning, was sitting in his little room in a somewhat
troubled humor, musing on many things, and little imagining
the intense interest he had excited in the feelings
of the amiable occupants of Satin Lodge, when a knock at
his door startled him out of his revery. Guess his amazement
to see, on opening it, Mr. Tag-rag!</p>

<p>"Your most obedient, sir," commenced that gentleman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
in a subdued and obsequious manner, plucking off his hat
the instant that he saw Titmouse. "I hope you're better,
sir!&mdash;Been very uneasy, sir, about you."</p>

<p>"Please to walk in, sir," replied Titmouse, not a little
flustered&mdash;"I'm better, sir, thank you."</p>

<p>"Happy to hear it, sir?&mdash;But am also come to offer
humble apologies for the rudeness of that upstart that
was so rude to you yesterday, at my premises&mdash;know
whom I mean, eh?&mdash;Lutestring&mdash;I shall get rid of him,
I do think"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir&mdash;&mdash; But&mdash;but&mdash;when I was in your employ"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Was</i> in my employ!" interrupted Tag-rag, with a sigh,
gazing earnestly at him&mdash;"It's no use trying to hide it
any longer! I've all along seen you was a world too
good for&mdash;in fact, quite above your situation in <i>my</i> poor
shop! I <i>may</i> have been wrong, Mr. Titmouse," he continued
diffidently, as he placed himself on what seemed
the only chair in the room, (Titmouse sitting on a common
wooden stool)&mdash;"but I did it for the best&mdash;eh?&mdash;don't
you understand me, Mr. Titmouse?" Titmouse
continued looking on the floor incredulously, sheepishly,
and somewhat sullenly.</p>

<p>"Very much obliged, sir," at length he answered&mdash;"but
must say you've rather a funny way of showing
it, sir. Look at the sort of life you've led me for this"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! knew you'd say so! But I can lay my hand on
my heart, Mr. Titmouse, and declare to God&mdash;I can, indeed,
Mr. Titmouse"&mdash;&mdash; Titmouse preserved a very embarrassing
silence.&mdash;"<i>See</i> I'm out of your good books&mdash;But&mdash;won't
you forget and forgive, Mr. Titmouse? I
<i>meant</i> well. Nay, I humbly beg forgiveness for everything
you've not liked in me. Can I say more? Come,
Mr. Titmouse, you've a noble nature, and I ask forgiveness!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
cried Tag-rag, softly and earnestly: you would
have thought that his life depended on his success in
what he was doing!</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you ought to do it before the whole shop, if
you're in earnest," replied Titmouse, a little relenting&mdash;"for
they've all seen your goings on."</p>

<p>"Them!&mdash;the brutes!&mdash;the vulgar fellows, eugh!&mdash;you
and I, Mr. Titmouse, are a <i>leetle</i> above such cattle as
them! D'&nbsp;ye think we ought to mind what <i>servants</i> say?&mdash;Only
you say the word, and I make a clean sweep of
'em all; you shall have the premises to yourself, Mr.
Titmouse, within an hour after any of those chaps shows
you the least glimmer of disrespect."</p>

<p>"Ah! I don't know&mdash;you've used me most uncommon
bad, 'pon my soul!&mdash;far worse than they have&mdash;you've
nearly broke my heart, sir! You have!"</p>

<p>"Well, my womankind at home are right, after all!
They told me all along I was going the wrong way to
work, when I said how I tried to keep your pride down,
and prevent you from having your head turned by knowing
your good looks! Over and over again, my little girl
has said, with tears in her dear eyes, 'you'll break his
spirit, dear papa&mdash;if he <i>is</i> handsome, wasn't it God that
made him so?'" The little frostwork which Titmouse
had thrown around his heart, began to melt like snow
under sunbeams. "Ah, Mr. Titmouse, Mr. Titmouse!
the women are always right, and <i>we're</i> always wrong,"
continued Tag-rag, earnestly, perceiving his advantage.
"Upon my soul I could kick myself for my stupidity,
and cruelty too!"</p>

<p>"Ah, I should think so! No one knows what I've
suffered! And now," added Titmouse, suddenly, "that
I'm&mdash;I suppose you've heard it all, sir?&mdash;what's in
the wind&mdash;and all that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;Mr. Gammon (that most respectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
gentleman) and I have had a long talk yesterday about you,
in which he did certainly tell me everything&mdash;nothing
like confidence, Mr. Titmouse, when gentleman meets
gentleman, you know! Oh, Lord! the news is really
delightful! delightful!"</p>

<p>"<i>Isn't</i> it, sir?" eagerly interrupted Titmouse, his eyes
glistening with sudden rapture.</p>

<p>"Ah! ten thous&mdash;I <i>must</i> shake hands with you, my
dear Mr. Titmouse;" quoth Tag-rag, with affectionate
excitement&mdash;and, for the first time in their lives, their
hands touched, Tag-rag squeezing that of Titmouse with
energetic cordiality; while he added, with a little emotion
in his tone&mdash;"Thomas Tag-rag may be a plain-spoken
and wrong-headed man, Mr. Titmouse&mdash;but he's a warm
heart, I assure you!"</p>

<p>"And did Mr. Gammon tell you <i>all</i>, sir?" eagerly interrupted Titmouse.</p>

<p>"Everything&mdash;everything; quite confidential, I assure
you, for he saw the interest I felt in you!"</p>

<p>"And did he say about my&mdash;hem!&mdash;eh? my stopping
a few weeks longer with you?" inquired Titmouse,
chagrin overspreading his features.</p>

<p>"I think he did, indeed, Mr. Titmouse! He's quite
bent on it, sir! And so would any true friend of yours
be&mdash;because you see!"&mdash;here he dropped his voice, and
looked very mysteriously at Titmouse&mdash;"in short I quite
agree with Mr. Gammon!"</p>

<p>"Do you indeed, sir?" exclaimed Titmouse, with rather
an uneasy look.</p>

<p>"I do, i' faith! Why, they'd give thousands and thousands
to get you out of the way&mdash;and what's <i>money</i> to
<i>them</i>? But they must look very sharp that get at you in
the premises of Thomas Tag-rag, I warrant 'em!&mdash;Talking
of that, ah, ha!&mdash;it <i>will</i> be a funny thing to see you,
Mr. Titmouse&mdash;Squire Titmouse&mdash;ah, ha, ha!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"You won't hardly expect me to go out with <i>goods</i>, I
suppose, sir?" inquired Titmouse, somewhat anxiously.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!&mdash;Ha, ha, ha!&mdash;Might as well ask me if
I'd clean that beast Lutestring's shoes! No, no, my dear
Mr. Titmouse, you and I have done with each other as
master and servant; it's only as friends that we know
each other now!&mdash;You may say and do whatever you
like, and come and go when and where you like!&mdash;It's
true it will make my other hands rather jealous, and get
me into trouble; but what do I care? Suppose they <i>do</i>
all give me warning for your sake? Let 'em go, say I!"
He snapped his fingers with an air of defiance. "<i>Your</i>
looks and manners would keep a shop full of customers&mdash;one
Titmouse is worth a hundred of them."</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul, you speak most uncommon gentleman-like,
sir, certainly!" said Titmouse, with a little excitement&mdash;"and
if you'd only <i>always</i>&mdash;but that's all past
and gone; and I've no objections to say at once, that all
the articles I may want in your line I'll have at your
establishment, pay cash down, and ask for no discount.
And I'll send all my friends, for, in course, sir, you know
I shall have lots of them!"</p>

<p>"Don't forget your oldest, your truest, your humblest
friend, Mr. Titmouse," said Tag-rag, with a cringing air.</p>

<p>"That I won't!" replied Titmouse, heatedly.</p>

<p>[It flashed across his mind that a true and old friend
would be only too happy to do him some such trifling service
as to lend him a ten-pound note.]</p>

<p>"Hem!&mdash;Now, <i>are</i> you such a friend, Mr. Tag-rag?"
cried he, sheepishly.</p>

<p>"Am I?&mdash;Can you doubt me? Try me! See what
I would not do for you! Friend, indeed!" and he looked
quite fondly at Titmouse.</p>

<p>"Well, I believe you; sir! And the fact is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;you see, Mr. Tag-rag, though all this heap of money's
<i>coming</i> to me, I'm precious low just <i>now</i>"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;e&mdash;e&mdash;s, Mr. Titmouse," quoth Tag-rag, anxiously;
his dull gray eye fixed on that of Titmouse steadfastly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if you've a mind to prove your words, Mr.
Tag-rag, and don't mind advancing me a ten-pound note"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hem!" involuntarily uttered Tag-rag, so suddenly
and violently, that it made Titmouse start. Then Tag-rag's
face flushed over; he twirled about his watch-key
rapidly, and wriggled about in his chair with visible agitation.</p>

<p>"Oh, you aren't going to do it! If so, you'd better
say it at once," quoth Titmouse, rather cavalierly.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;<i>was</i> ever anything so unfortunate?" stammered
Tag-rag. "That cursed lot of French goods I
bought only yesterday, to be paid for this very morning&mdash;and
it will drain me of every penny!"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;yes! True! Well, it don't much signify," said
Titmouse, carelessly, running his hand through his bushy
hair. "In fact, I needn't have bothered an old friend
at all, now I think of it&mdash;Mr. Gammon says he's my
banker to any amount. I beg pardon, I'm sure"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Tag-rag was in a horrid dilemma. He felt so flustered
by the suddenness and seriousness of the thing, that he
could not see his way plain in any direction.</p>

<p>"Let me see," at length he stammered; and pulling a
ready-reckoner out of his pocket, he affected to be consulting
it, as if to ascertain merely the state of his banker's
account, but really desiring a few moments' time to
collect his thoughts. 'Twas in vain, however; nothing
occurred to him; he saw no way of escape; his old friend
the devil deserted him for a moment&mdash;supplying him
with no ready lie to meet the exigency. He must, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
feared, cash up! "Well," said he&mdash;"it certainly <i>is</i> rather
unfortunate, just at this precise moment; but I'll step to
the shop, and see how my ready-money matters stand.
It sha'n't be a trifle, Mr. Titmouse, that shall stand between
us. But&mdash;if I <i>should</i> be hard run&mdash;perhaps&mdash;eh?
Would a five-pound note do?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;certainly, if it wouldn't suit you to
advance the ten"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I dare say," interrupted Tag-rag, a trifle relieved, "I
shall be able to accommodate you <i>so</i> far. Perhaps you'll
step on to the shop presently, and then we can talk over
matters!&mdash;By the way, did you ever see anything so odd?
forgot the main thing! <i>Do</i> come and take your mutton
with me at Clapham next Sunday&mdash;my womankind
will be quite delighted. Nay, 'tis <i>their</i> invitation&mdash;ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"You're uncommon polite," replied Titmouse, coloring
with pleasure. Here seemed the first pale primrose of
the coming spring&mdash;an invitation to Satin Lodge!</p>

<p>"The politeness&mdash;the favor&mdash;will be yours, Mr. Titmouse!
I'm uncommon proud of your coming! We
shall be quite alone! have you all to ourselves; only
me, my wife, and daughter&mdash;an only child, Mr. Titmouse&mdash;<i>such</i>
a child! She's really often said to me,
'I wonder'&mdash;but,&mdash;&mdash; I won't make you vain, eh?
<i>Shall</i> I call it a fixture?"</p>

<p>"'Pon my life, Mr. Tag-rag, you're monstrous uncommon
polite. It's true, I was going to dine with
Mr. Gammon"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! pho! (I mean no disrespect, mind!) he's only
a bachelor&mdash;<i>I've</i> got ladies in the case, and all that&mdash;eh,
Mr. Titmouse? and a <i>young</i> one!"</p>

<p>"Well, thank you, sir. Since you're so pressing"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's it! An engagement, poz!&mdash;Satin Lodge&mdash;for
Sunday next," said Tag-rag, rising and looking at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
watch. "Time for me to be off. See you soon at the
shop? Soon arrange that little matter of business, eh?
You understand? Good-by! good-by!" and shaking Titmouse
cordially by the hand, Tag-rag took his departure.
As he hurried on to his shop, he felt in a most painful
perplexity about this loan of five pounds. It was truly
like squeezing five drops of blood out of his heart.
But what was to be done? Could he offend Titmouse?
Where was he to stop, if he once began? Dare he ask
for security? Suppose the whole affair should after all
turn into smoke?</p>

<p>Now, consider the folly of Tag-rag. Here was he in
all this terrible pucker about advancing <i>five pounds</i> on
the strength of prospects and chances which he had
deemed safe for adventuring <i>his daughter</i> upon&mdash;her,
the only object on earth, except money, that he regarded
with anything like sincere affection. How was this?
The splendor of the future possible good fortune of his
daughter, might, perhaps, have dazzled and confused his
perceptions. Then, again, <i>that</i> was a <i>remote</i> contingent
venture; but this sudden appeal to his pocket&mdash;the demand
of an immediate outlay and venture&mdash;was an
instant pressure, and he felt it severely. Immediate
profit was everything to Tag-rag&mdash;'twas his very life's
blood! He was, in truth, a <i>tradesman to his heart's core</i>.
If he could have seen the immediate <i>quid pro quo</i>, or
could, at all events, have got, if only by way of earnest,
as it were, a bit of poor Titmouse's heart, and locked it
up in his desk, he would not have cared so much; it
would have been a little in his line;&mdash;but here was a
<span class="smcap">Five-Pound Note</span> going out forthwith, and nothing immediate,
visible, palpable, replacing it. Oh! Titmouse had
unconsciously pulled Tag-rag's very heart-strings!</p>

<p>Observe, discriminating reader, that there is all the
difference in the world between a <span class="smcap">Tradesman</span> and a <span class="smcap">Merchant</span>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and, moreover, that it is not every <i>tradesman</i> that
is a Tag-rag.</p>

<p>All these considerations combined to keep Tag-rag in a
perfect fever of doubt and anxiety, which several hearty
curses (I regret to say) failed in effectually relieving.
By the time, however, that Titmouse had made his appearance
at Mr. Tag-rag's shop, with a sufficiently sheepish
air, and was beginning to run the gantlet of grinning
contempt from the "<i>gents</i>" on each side of the shop, Tag-rag
had determined on the course he should pursue in
the very embarrassing matter above referred to. To the
inexpressible amazement of all present, he bolted out of a
little counting-house or side-room, hastened to meet Titmouse
with outstretched hand and cordial speech, drew
him into his little room, and shut the door. There Tag-rag
informed his flurried young friend that he had made
arrangements (with a little inconvenience, which, however,
between friends, signified nothing) for lending Titmouse
five pounds.</p>

<p>"And, as life's uncertain, my dear Mr. Titmouse," said
Tag-rag, as Titmouse, with ill-disguised ecstasy, put the
five-pound note into his pocket&mdash;"even between the
dearest friends&mdash;eh? Understand? It's not <i>you</i> I
fear, nor you me, because we've confidence in each other.
But if anything should happen, those we leave behind
us"&mdash;&mdash; Here he took out of his desk an "I. O. U. £5,"
ready drawn up and dated&mdash;"a mere slip&mdash;a word or
two&mdash;is satisfaction to both of us."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir! yes, sir!&mdash;anything!" said Titmouse; and
hastily taking the pen proffered him, signed his name, on
which Tag-rag felt a little relieved. Lutestring was then
summoned into the room, and thus (not a little to his disgust
and astonishment) addressed by his imperious employer:
"Mr. Lutestring, you will have the goodness to
see that Mr. Titmouse, while he may do me the honor to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
condescend to be here, is treated by every person in my
establishment with the utmost possible respect. Whoever
treats this gentleman with the slightest disrespect isn't
any longer a servant of mine. D'&nbsp;ye hear me, Mr.
Lutestring?" added Tag-rag, sternly, observing a very
significant glance of mingled hatred and wonder which
Lutestring directed towards Titmouse. "D'&nbsp;ye hear
me, sir?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir! yes, sir! your orders shall be attended to,"
he replied in as insolent a tone as he could venture upon,
leaving the room with a half audible whistle of contempt,
while a grin overspread his features. Within five minutes
he had filled, the mind of every shopman in the
establishment with feelings of mingled wonder, hatred,
and fear towards Titmouse. What, thought they, could
have happened? What was Mr. Tag-rag about? This
was all of a piece with his rage at Lutestring the day
before. "Cuss Titmouse! and Tag-rag too!" said or
thought every one of them!</p>

<p>Titmouse, for the remainder of the day, felt, as may be
imagined, but little at his ease; for&mdash;to say nothing of
his insuperable repugnance to the discharge of any of his
former duties&mdash;his uneasiness under the oppressive civilities
of Mr. Tag-rag; and the evident disgust towards
him entertained by his companions; many most important
considerations arising out of recent and coming
events&mdash;his altering circumstances&mdash;were momentarily
forcing themselves upon his attention. The first of these
was his <i>hair</i>; for Heaven seemed to have suddenly given
him the long-coveted means of changing its detested hue;
and the next was <i>an eyeglass</i>, without which, he had long
felt his appearance and appointments to be painfully incomplete.
Early in the afternoon, therefore, on the
readily admitted plea of important business, he obtained
the permission of the obsequious Mr. Tag-rag to depart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
for the day; and instantly directed his steps to the well-known
shop of a fashionable perfumer and perruquier, in
Bond Street&mdash;well-known to those, at least, who were in
the habit of glancing at the enticing advertisements in the
newspapers. Having watched through the window till
the coast was clear, (for he felt a natural delicacy in asking
for a hair-dye before people who could in an instant
perceive his urgent occasion for it,) he entered the shop,
where a well-dressed gentleman was sitting behind the
counter reading. He was handsome; and his elaborately
curled hair was of a heavenly black (so at least Titmouse
considered it) which was better than a thousand printed
advertisements of the celebrated fluid which formed the
chief commodity there vended. Titmouse with a little
hesitation, asked this gentleman what was the price of
their article "for turning <i>light</i> hair black"&mdash;and was
answered&mdash;"only seven and sixpence for the smaller-sized
bottle." One was in a twinkling placed upon the
counter, where it lay like a miniature mummy, swathed,
as it were, in manifold advertisements. "You'll find the
fullest directions within, and testimonials from the highest
nobility to the wonderful efficacy of the
'<span class="smcap">Cyanochaitanthropopoion</span>.'"[<a href='#Note_12'>12</a>]</p>

<p>"<i>Sure</i> it will do, sir?" inquired Titmouse, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Is <i>my</i> hair dark enough to your taste, sir?" said the
gentleman, with a calm and bland manner&mdash;"because I
owe it entirely to this invaluable specific."</p>

<p>"Do you, indeed, sir?" inquired Titmouse: adding
with a sigh, "but, between ourselves, look at mine!"&mdash;and,
lifting off his hat for a moment, he exhibited a great
crop of bushy, carroty hair.</p>

<p>"Whew! rather ugly that, sir!"&mdash;exclaimed the gentleman,
looking very serious&mdash;"What a curse it is to be
born with such hair, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"'Pon my life I think so, sir!" answered Titmouse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
mournfully; "and do you really say, sir, that this what's-its-name
turned <i>yours</i> of that beautiful black?"</p>

<p>"Think? 'Pon my honor, sir,&mdash;certain; no mistake,
I assure you! I was fretting myself into my grave about
the color of my hair! Why, sir, there was a nobleman
in here (I don't like to mention names) the other day,
with a head that seemed as if it had been dipped into
water, and then powdered with brick-dust; but&mdash;I assure
you, the Cyanochaitanthropopoion was too much for
it&mdash;it turned black in a very short time. You should
have seen his lordship's ecstasy&mdash;[the speaker saw that
Titmouse would swallow anything; so he went on with a
confident air]&mdash;and in a month's time he had married a
beautiful woman whom he had loved from a child, but
who had vowed she could never bring herself to marry
a man with such a head of hair."</p>

<p>"How long does it take to do all this, sir?" interrupted
Titmouse, eagerly, with a beating heart.</p>

<p>"Sometimes two&mdash;sometimes three days. In four
days' time, I'll answer for it, your most intimate friend
would not know you. My wife did not know me for a
long while, and wouldn't let me salute her&mdash;ha, ha!"
Here another customer entered; and Titmouse, laying
down the five-pound note he had squeezed out of Tag-rag,
put the wonder-working bottle into his pocket, and
on receiving his change, departed, bursting with eagerness
to try the effects of the Cyanochaitanthropopoion.
Within half an hour's time he might have been seen
driving a hard bargain with a pawnbroker for a massive-looking
eyeglass, upon which, as it hung suspended in
the window, he had for months cast a longing eye; and
he eventually purchased it (his eyesight, I need hardly
say, was perfect) for only fifteen shillings. After taking
a hearty dinner in a little dusky eating-house in Rupert
Street, frequented by fashionable-looking foreigners, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
splendid heads of curling hair and mustaches, he hastened
home, eager to commence the grand experiment. Fortunately,
he was undisturbed that evening. Having lit
his candle, and locked his door, with tremulous fingers he
opened the papers enveloping the little bottle; and glancing
over their contents, got so inflamed with the numberless
instances of its efficacy, detailed in brief but glowing
terms&mdash;as&mdash;the "Duke of....&mdash;the Countess of....&mdash;the
Earl of, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;the lovely
Miss&mdash;&mdash;, the celebrated Sir Little Bull's-eye, (who
was so gratified that he allowed his name to be used)&mdash;all
of whom, from having hair of the reddest possible description,
were now possessed of raven-hued locks"&mdash;that
he threw down the paper, and hurriedly got the cork out
of the bottle. Having turned up his coat-cuffs, he commenced
the application of the Cyanochaitanthropopoion,
rubbing it into his hair, eyebrows, and whiskers, with all
the energy he was capable of, for upwards of half an hour.
Then he read over again every syllable on the papers in
which the bottle had been wrapped; and about eleven
o'clock, having given sundry curious glances at the glass,
got into bed, full of exciting hopes and delightful anxieties
concerning the success of the great experiment he
was trying. He could not sleep for several hours. He
dreamed a rapturous dream&mdash;that he bowed to a gentleman
with coal-black hair, whom he fancied he had seen
before&mdash;and suddenly discovered that he was only looking
at <i>himself</i> in a glass!!&mdash;This awoke him. Up he
jumped&mdash;sprang to his little glass breathlessly&mdash;but ah!
merciful Heavens! he almost dropped down dead! His
hair was perfectly <i>green</i>&mdash;there could be no mistake
about it. He stood staring in the glass in speechless
horror, his eyes and mouth distended to their utmost,
for several minutes. Then he threw himself on the
bed, and felt fainting. Out he presently jumped again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
in a kind of ecstasy&mdash;rubbed his hair desperately and
wildly about&mdash;again looked into the glass&mdash;there it was,
rougher than before; but eyebrows, whiskers, and head&mdash;all
were, if anything, of a more vivid and brilliant green.
Despair came over him. What had all his past troubles
been to this?&mdash;what was to become of him? He got
into bed again, and burst into a perspiration. Two or
three times he got into and out of bed, to look at himself&mdash;on
each occasion deriving only more terrible confirmation
than before, of the disaster which had befallen
him. After lying still for some minutes, he got out of
bed, and kneeling down, tried to say his prayers; but it
was in vain&mdash;and he rose half choked. It was plain he
must have his head shaved, and wear a wig, which would
be making an old man of him at once. Getting more
and more disturbed in his mind, he dressed himself, half
determined on starting off to Bond Street, and breaking
every pane of glass in the shop window of the infernal
impostor who had sold him the liquid which had
so frightfully disfigured him. As he stood thus irresolute,
he heard the step of Mrs. Squallop approaching his
door, and recollected that he had ordered her to bring up
his tea-kettle about that time. Having no time to take
his clothes off, he thought the best thing he could do,
would be, to pop into bed again, draw his nightcap down
to his ears and eyebrows, pretend to be asleep, and, turning
his back towards the door, have a chance of escaping
the observation of his landlady. No sooner thought of,
than done. Into bed he jumped, and drew the clothes
over him&mdash;not aware, however, that in his hurry he had
left his legs, with boots and trousers on, exposed to view&mdash;an
unusual spectacle to his landlady, who had, in fact,
scarcely ever known him in bed at so late an hour before.
He lay as still as a mouse. Mrs. Squallop, after glancing
with surprise at his legs, happening to direct her eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
towards the window, beheld a small bottle standing there&mdash;only
half of whose dark contents were remaining. Oh
gracious!&mdash;of course it must be <span class="smcap">poison</span>, and Mr. Titmouse
must be dead!&mdash;In a sudden fright she dropped the kettle,
plucked the clothes off the trembling Titmouse, and
cried out&mdash;"Oh, Mr. Titmouse! Mr. Titmouse! what
<i>have</i> you been"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, ma'am, what the devil do you mean? How
dare you"&mdash;&mdash; commenced Titmouse, suddenly sitting
up, and looking furiously at Mrs. Squallop. An inconceivably
strange and horrid figure he looked. He had all
his day clothes on; a white cotton nightcap was drawn
down to his very eyes, like a man going to be hanged;
his face was very pale, and his whiskers were of a bright
green color.</p>

<p>"Lard a-mighty!" exclaimed Mrs. Squallop, faintly,
the moment that this strange apparition had presented
itself; and sinking on the chair, she pointed with a dismayed
air to the ominous-looking object standing on
the window shelf. Titmouse thence inferred that she
had found out the true state of the case. "Well&mdash;<i>isn't</i>
it an infernal shame, Mrs. Squallop?" said he, getting
off the bed; and, plucking off his nightcap, he exhibited
the full extent of his misfortune. "What d'ye
think of <i>that</i>!" he exclaimed, staring wildly at her. Mrs.
Squallop gave a faint shriek, turned her head aside, and
motioned him away.</p>

<p>"I shall go mad&mdash;I <span class="smcap">shall</span>!" cried Titmouse, tearing
his green hair.</p>

<p>"Oh Lord!&mdash;oh Lord!" groaned Mrs. Squallop, evidently
expecting him to leap upon her. Presently, however,
she a little recovered her presence of mind; and
Titmouse, stuttering with fury, explained to her what had
taken place. As he went on, Mrs. Squallop became less
and less able to control herself, and at length burst into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
a fit of convulsive laughter, and sat holding her hands to
her fat shaking sides, and appearing likely to tumble off
her chair. Titmouse was almost on the point of striking
her! At length, however, the fit went off; and wiping
her eyes, she expressed the greatest commiseration for
him, and proposed to go down and fetch up some soft
soap and flannel, and try what "a good hearty wash
would do." Scarce sooner said than done&mdash;but, alas,
in vain! Scrub, scrub&mdash;lather, lather, did they both;
but, the instant that the soap-suds had been washed off,
there was the head as green as ever!</p>

<p>"Oh, murder, murder! what <i>am</i> I to do, Mrs. Squallop?"
groaned Titmouse, having taken another look at
himself in the glass.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;really I'd be off to a police-office, and have
'em all taken up, if as how I was <i>you!</i>" quoth Mrs. Squallop.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;See if I don't take that bottle, and make the
fellow that sold it me swallow what's left&mdash;and I'll
smash in his shop front besides!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you won't&mdash;you mustn't&mdash;not on no account!
Stop at home a bit, and be quiet; it may go off with all
this washing, in the course of the day. Soft soap is an
uncommon strong thing for getting colors out&mdash;but&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;excuse
me now, Mr. Titmouse"&mdash;said Mrs. Squallop,
seriously&mdash;"why wasn't you satisfied with the hair
God Almighty had given you? D'&nbsp;ye think He didn't
know a deal better than you what was best for you? I'm
blest if I don't think this is a judgment on you, when one
comes to consider!"</p>

<p>"What's the use of your standing preaching to me in
this way, Mrs. Squallop?" said Titmouse, first with amazement,
and then with fury in his manner&mdash;"A'n't I half
mad without it? Judgment or no judgment&mdash;where's
the harm of my wanting black hair any more than black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
trousers? That a'n't <i>your own</i> hair, Mrs. Squallop&mdash;you're
as gray as a badger underneath&mdash;'pon my soul!
I've often remarked it&mdash;I <i>have</i>, 'pon my soul!"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, Mr. Himperance!" furiously exclaimed
Mrs. Squallop, "you're a liar! And you deserve
what you've got! It <i>is</i> a judgment, and I hope
it will stick by you&mdash;so take <i>that</i> for your sauce, you
vulgar fellow!" (snapping her fingers at him.) "Get rid
of your green hair if you can! It's only carrot <i>tops</i> instead
of carrot <i>roots</i>&mdash;and some likes one, some the other&mdash;ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, Mrs. Squ"&mdash;&mdash; he commenced,
but she had gone, having slammed to the door behind
her with all her force; and Titmouse was left alone in
a half frantic state, in which he continued for nearly two
hours. Once again he read over the atrocious puffs which
had over-night inflated him to such a degree, and he now
saw that they were all lies. This is a sample of them:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This divine fluid (as it was enthusiastically styled to the inventor,
by the lovely Duchess of Dunderwhistle) possesses the
inestimable and astonishing quality of changing hair, of whatever
color, to a dazzling jet-black; at the same time imparting
to it a rich glossy appearance, which wonderfully contributes to
the imposing <i>tout-ensemble</i> presented by those who use it. That
well-known ornament of the circle of fashion, the young and
lovely Mrs. Fitzfrippery, owned to the proprietor that to this
surprising fluid it was that she was indebted for those unrivalled
raven ringlets which attracted the eyes of envying and admiring
crowds," and so forth.</p></div>

<p>A little farther on:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This exquisite effect is not <i>in all cases</i> produced instantaneously;
much will of course depend (as the celebrated M. Dupuytren,
of the Hôtel Dieu, at Paris, informed the inventor)
on the physical idiosyncrasy of the party using it, with reference
to the constituent particles of the coloring matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
constituting the fluid in the capillary vessels. Often a single
application suffices to change the most hopeless-looking head
of red hair to as deep a black; but, not unfrequently, the hair
<i>passes through intermediate shades and tints</i>&mdash;all, however,
ultimately settling into a deep and permanent black."</p></div>

<p>This passage not a little revived the drooping spirits of
Titmouse. Accidentally, however, an asterisk at the last
word in the above sentence, directed his eye to a note at
the bottom of the page, printed in such minute type as
would have baffled any but the strongest sight and most
determined eye to read, and which said note was the
following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Though cases <i>do</i>, undoubtedly, occasionally occur, in which
the native inherent indestructible qualities of the hair defy
all attempts at change or even modification, and resist even
<i>this</i> potent remedy: of which, however, in all his experience"
(the wonderful specific has been invented for about <i>six months</i>)
"the inventor has known but very few instances."</p></div>

<p>But to this exceedingly select class of unfortunate incurables,
poor Titmouse, alas! entertained a dismal suspicion
that <i>he</i> belonged.</p>

<p>"Look, sir! Look! Only look here what your cussed
stuff has done to my hair!" said Titmouse, on presenting
himself soon after to the gentleman who had sold him the
infernal liquid; and, taking off his hat, exposed his green
hair. The gentleman, however, did not appear at all
surprised, or discomposed.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;yes! I see&mdash;I see. You're in the intermediate
stage. It differs in different people"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Differs, sir! I'm going mad! I look like a green
monkey&mdash;Cuss me if I don't!"</p>

<p>"In <i>me</i>, now," replied the gentleman, with a matter-of-fact
air, "the color was a strong <i>yellow</i>. But have you
read the explanations that are given in the wrapper?"</p>

<p>"Read 'em?" echoed Titmouse, furiously&mdash;"I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
think so? Much good they do <i>me</i>! Sir, you're a humbug!&mdash;an
impostor! I'm a sight to be seen for the
rest of my life! Look at me, sir! Eyebrows, whiskers,
and all!"</p>

<p>"<i>Rather</i> a singular appearance, just at present, I must
own," said the gentleman, his face turning suddenly red
all over with the violent effort he was making to prevent
an explosion of laughter. He soon, however, recovered
himself, and added coolly&mdash;"If you'll only persevere"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Persevere be d&mdash;&mdash;d!" interrupted Titmouse, violently
clapping his hat on his head, "I'll teach you to
<i>persevere</i> in taking in the public! I'll have a warrant out
against you in no time!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear sir, I'm accustomed to all this!" said
the gentleman, coolly.</p>

<p>"The&mdash;devil&mdash;you&mdash;are!" gasped Titmouse, quite aghast.</p>

<p>"Oh, often&mdash;often, while the liquid is performing the
first stage of the change; but, in a day or two afterwards,
the parties generally come back smiling into my shop,
with heads as black as crows!"</p>

<p>"No! But really&mdash;do they, sir?" interrupted Titmouse,
drawing a long breath.</p>

<p>"Hundreds, I may say thousands, my dear sir! And
one lady gave me a picture of herself, in her black hair,
to make up for her abuse of me when it was in a puce
color&mdash;Fact, honor!"</p>

<p>"But do you recollect any one's hair turning <i>green</i>,
and then getting black?" inquired Titmouse, with trembling anxiety.</p>

<p>"Recollect any? Fifty at least. For instance, there
was Lord Albert Addlehead&mdash;but why should I mention
names? I know hundreds! But everything is honor
and confidential <i>here</i>!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"And did Lord what's-his-name's hair grow green, and
then black; and was it at first as light as mine?"</p>

<p>"His hair was redder, and in consequence it became
greener, and now is blacker than ever yours will be."</p>

<p>"Well, if I and my landlady have this morning used
an ounce, we've used a quarter of a pound of soft soap in"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Soft soap!&mdash;soft soap!" cried out the gentleman, with
an air of sudden alarm&mdash;"That explains all," (he forgot
how well it had been already explained by him.) "By
Heavens, sir!&mdash;soft soap! You may have ruined your
hair forever!" Titmouse opened his eyes and mouth
with a start of terror, it not occurring to his astute mind
that the intolerable green had preceded, not followed, the
use of the soft soap. "Go home, my dear sir! God bless
you&mdash;go home, as you value your hair; take this small
bottle of <span class="smcap">Damascus Cream</span>, and rub it in before it's too
late; and then use the remainder of the"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then you don't think it's already too late?" inquired
Titmouse, faintly; and, having been assured to the contrary&mdash;having
asked the price of the Damascus cream,
which was "<i>only</i> three-and-sixpence," (stamp included)&mdash;he
purchased and paid for it with a rueful air, and
took his departure. He sneaked homeward along the
streets with the air of a pickpocket, fearful that every one
he met was an officer who had his eye on him. He was
not, in fact, very far off the mark; for many a person
smiled, and stared, and turned round to look at him as
he went along.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>
<hr class='chapter' />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>Titmouse slunk up-stairs to his room in a sad state of
depression, and spent the next hour in rubbing into his
hair the Damascus cream. He rubbed till he could hardly
hold his arms up any longer, from sheer fatigue. Having
risen at length to mark, from the glass, the progress he
had made, he found that the only result of his persevering
exertions had been to give a greasy shining appearance
to the hair, which remained green as ever. With a
half-uttered groan he sank down upon a chair, and fell
into a sort of abstraction, which was interrupted by a
sharp knock at his door. Titmouse started up, trembled,
and stood for a moment or two irresolute, glancing fearfully
at the glass; and then, opening the door, let in&mdash;Mr.
Gammon, who started back a pace or two, as if he
had been shot, on catching sight of the strange figure of
Titmouse. It was useless for Gammon to try to check his
laughter; so, leaning against the door-post, he yielded to
the impulse, and laughed without intermission for nearly
a couple of minutes. Titmouse felt desperately angry,
but feared to show it; and the timid, rueful, lackadaisical
air with which he regarded the dreaded Mr. Gammon,
only prolonged and aggravated the agonies of that gentleman.
When at length he had a little recovered himself,
holding his left hand to his side, with an exhausted air, he
entered the little apartment, and asked Titmouse what in
the name of heaven he had been doing to himself: "<i>Without
this</i>" (in the absurd slang of the lawyers) that he suspected
most vehemently, all the while, what Titmouse had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
been about; but he wished to hear Titmouse's own account
of the matter!&mdash;Titmouse, not daring to hesitate,
complied&mdash;Gammon listening in an agony of suppressed
laughter. He looked as little at Titmouse as he could,
and was growing a trifle more sedate, when Titmouse, in
a truly lamentable tone, inquired, "What's the good, Mr.
Gammon, of ten thousand a-year with such a horrid head
of hair as this?" On hearing which Gammon jumped off
his chair, started to the window, and laughed for one or
two minutes without ceasing. This was too much for Titmouse,
who presently cried aloud in a lamentable manner;
and Gammon, suddenly ceasing his laughter, turned round
and apologized in the most earnest manner; after which
he uttered an abundance of sympathy for the sufferings
which "he deplored being unable to alleviate." He even
restrained himself when Titmouse again and again asked
if he could not "have the law" of the man who had so
imposed on him. Gammon diverted the thoughts of his
suffering client, by taking from his pocket some very
imposing packages of paper, tied round with red tape.
From time to time, however, he almost split his nose
with efforts to restrain his laughter, on catching a fresh
glimpse of poor Titmouse's emerald hair. Mr. Gammon
was a man of business, however; and in the midst of all
this distracting excitement, contrived to get Titmouse's
signature to sundry papers of no little consequence;
among others, first, to a bond conditioned for the payment
of £500; secondly, another for £10,000;&mdash;both to
Caleb Quirk, gentleman; and lastly, an agreement (of
which he gave Titmouse <i>an alleged</i> copy) by which Titmouse,
in consideration of Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and
Snap using their best exertions to put him in possession
of the estate, &amp;c. &amp;c., bound himself to conform to their
wishes in everything, on pain of their instantly throwing
up the whole affair, looking out for another heir at law (!)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
and issuing execution forthwith against Titmouse for
all expenses incurred under his retainer. I said that
Gammon gave his confiding client an <i>alleged</i> copy of this
agreement;&mdash;it was not a real copy, for certain stipulations
appeared in each, which were not intended to appear
<i>in</i> the other, for reasons which were perfectly satisfactory
to&mdash;Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap. When Gammon
had got to this point, he thought it the fitting opportunity
for producing a second five-pound note. He
did so, and put Titmouse thereby into an ecstasy, which
pushed out of his head for a while all recollection of
what had happened to the outside of it. He had at that
moment nearly eleven pounds in hard cash. Gammon
easily obtained from him an account of his little money
transactions with Huckaback&mdash;of which, however, all he
could tell was&mdash;that for ten shillings down, he had given
a written engagement to pay fifty pounds on getting the
estate. Of this Gammon made a careful memorandum,
explaining to Titmouse the atrocious villany of Huckaback&mdash;and,
in short, that if he (Titmouse) did not look
very sharply about him, he would be robbed right and
left; so that it was of the utmost consequence to him
early to learn how to distinguish between false and true
friends. Gammon went on to assure him that the instrument
which he had given to Huckaback, was probably, in
point of law, not worth a farthing, on the ground of its
being both fraudulent and usurious; and intimated something,
which Titmouse did not very distinctly comprehend,
about the efficacy of a bill in equity for a <i>discovery</i>;
which&mdash;merely to expose villany&mdash;at a very insignificant
expense, (not exceeding £100,) would enable the plaintiff
in equity to put the defendant in equity, (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Huckaback,)
in the way of declaring, on his solemn oath, that he had
advanced the full sum of £50; and having obtained this
important and satisfactory result, Titmouse would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the opportunity of disproving the statement of Huckaback&mdash;<i>if
he could</i>: which of course he could not. By this process,
however, a little profitable employment would have
been afforded to a certain distinguished firm in Saffron
Hill&mdash;and that was <i>something</i>&mdash;to Gammon.</p>

<p>"But, by the way, talking of money," said Titmouse,
suddenly, "you can't think how surprising handsome Mr.
Tag-rag has behaved to me!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, my dear sir!" exclaimed Gammon, with real
curiosity, "what has he done?"</p>

<p>"Advanced to me five pounds&mdash;all of his own head!"</p>

<p>"Are you serious, Mr. Titmouse?" inquired Gammon.</p>

<p>Titmouse produced the change which he had obtained
for Tag-rag's five-pound note, minus only the prices of the
Cyanochaitanthropopoion, the Damascus cream, and the
eyeglass. Gammon merely stroked his chin in a thoughtful
manner. So occupied, indeed, was he with his reflections,
that though his eye was fixed on the ludicrous
figure of Titmouse, which so shortly before had occasioned
him such paroxysms of laughter, he did not feel the least
inclination even to a smile. Tag-rag advance Titmouse
five pounds! A-hem!&mdash;Throwing as much smiling indifference
into his manner as was possible, he asked Titmouse
the particulars of so strange a transaction. Titmouse answered
(how truly the reader can judge) that Mr. Tag-rag
had, in the very handsomest way, volunteered the loan of
five pounds; and moreover offered him any further sum
he might require!</p>

<p>"What a charming change, Mr. Titmouse!" exclaimed
Gammon, with a watchful eye and anxious smile.</p>

<p>"Most delightful, 'pon my soul!"</p>

<p>"Rather sudden, too!&mdash;eh?&mdash;Mr. Titmouse?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;no&mdash;no; I should say, 'pon my life, certainly
not. The fact is, we've long misunderstood each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
other. He's had an uncommon good opinion of me all
the while&mdash;people <i>have</i> tried to set him against me; but
it's no use, he's found them out&mdash;he told me so! And
he's not only said, but <i>done</i> the handsome thing! He's
turned up, by Jove, a trump all of a sudden&mdash;though
it's long looked an ugly card, to be sure!"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!&mdash;very!&mdash;how curious!" exclaimed
Mr. Gammon, mechanically; revolving several important
matters in his mind.</p>

<p>"I'm going, too, to dine at Satin Lodge, Mr. Tag-rag's
country house, next Sunday."</p>

<p>"Indeed! It will be quite a change for you, Mr. Titmouse!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it will, by Jove; and&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;what's
more&mdash;there's&mdash;hem!&mdash;you understand?"</p>

<p>"Go on, I beg, my dear Mr. Titmouse"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"There's a lady in the case&mdash;not that she's <i>said</i> anything;
but a nod's as good as a wink to a blind horse&mdash;eh? Mr. Gammon?"</p>

<p>"I should think so&mdash;Miss Tag-rag will have money, of course?"</p>

<p>"You've hit it! Lots! But I've not made up my mind."</p>

<p>[I'd better undeceive this poor devil at once, as to
this sordid wretch Tag-rag, (thought Gammon,) otherwise
the cunning old rogue may get a very mischievous
hold upon him! And a <i>lady in the case</i>! The old
scamp has a daughter! Whew! this will never do! The
sooner I enlighten my young friend the better&mdash;though
at a little risk.]</p>

<p>"It's very important to be able to tell who are real
and who false friends, as I was saying just now, my dear
Titmouse," said Gammon, seriously.</p>

<p>"I think so. Now look for instance, there's that
fellow Huckaback. I should say <i>he</i>"&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pho! pho! my dear sir, a mere beetle&mdash;he's not
worth thinking of, one way or the other. But can't
you guess another sham friend, who has changed so suddenly?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean Mr. Tag-rag&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"I mention no names; but it's rather odd, that when
I am speaking of hollow-hearted friends, <i>you</i> should at
once name Mr. Tag-rag&mdash;ah, ha, Mr. Titmouse!"</p>

<p>"The proof of the pudding&mdash;handsome is that handsome
does; and I've got £5 of his money, at any rate."</p>

<p>"Of course he took no <i>security</i> for such a trifle, between
such <i>very</i> close friends?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;why&mdash;now you mention it&mdash;But 'twas only
a line&mdash;one line&mdash;a mere <i>mem.</i> betwixt two gents&mdash;and
I noticed it had no stamp!"</p>

<p>"I guessed as much, my dear sir," interrupted Gammon,
calmly, with a significant smile&mdash;"Tag-rag and
Huckaback are quite on a par&mdash;a brace of worthies&mdash;ah,
ha, ha! My dear Titmouse, you are too honest and confiding!"</p>

<p>"What keen eyes you lawyers have to be sure! Well&mdash;I
never"&mdash;said Titmouse, looking very grave&mdash;for
he was evidently somewhat staggered. "I&mdash;I&mdash;must
say," he presently added, looking gratefully at Gammon,
"I think I <i>do</i> now know of a true friend, that sent me
two five-pound notes, and never asked for any security."</p>

<p>"My dear sir, you really pain me by alluding to such
a matter!"</p>

<p>[Oh, Gammon, is not this too bad? What are the
papers which you know are now in your pocket, signed
only this very evening by Titmouse?]</p>

<p>"You are not a match for Tag-rag, Mr. Titmouse; because
he was <i>made</i> for a tradesman&mdash;you are not. Do
you think he would have parted with his £5 but for
value received? Oh, Tag-rag! Tag-rag!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"I&mdash;I really begin to think, Mr. Gammon&mdash;'pon my
soul, I do think you're right."</p>

<p>"Think!&mdash;why&mdash;for a man of your acuteness&mdash;how
could he imagine you could forget the long course of
insult and tyranny which you have endured under him:
that he should change all of a sudden&mdash;just now, when"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ay, by Jove! just when I'm coming into my property,"
interrupted Titmouse, quickly.</p>

<p>"To be sure&mdash;to be sure! just now, I say, to make
this sudden change! Bah! bah!"</p>

<p>"I hate Tag-rag, and always did. Now he's trying to
take me in, just as he does everybody; but I've found
him out; I won't lay out a penny with him!"</p>

<p>"Would you, do you think, ever have seen the inside
of Satin Lodge, if you hadn't"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know; I really think&mdash;hem!"</p>

<p>"<i>Would</i> you, my dear sir?&mdash;But now a scheme occurs
to me&mdash;a very amusing idea indeed! Ah, ha, ha!&mdash;Shall
I tell you a way of proving to his own face how
insincere and interested he is towards you? Go to dinner
by all means, eat his good things, hear all that the whole
set of them have to say, and just before you go, (it will
require you to have your wits about you,) pretend, with
a long face, that our affair is all a bottle of smoke: say
that Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap have told you the
day before that they had made a horrid mistake, and you
were the wrong man"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Pon my life, I&mdash;I&mdash;really," stammered Titmouse
"daren't&mdash;I couldn't&mdash;I couldn't keep it up&mdash;he'd
half kill me. Besides, there will be Miss Tag-rag&mdash;it
would be the death of her, I know."</p>

<p>"Miss Tag-rag! Gracious Heavens! What on earth
can you have to do with <i>her</i>? <i>You</i>&mdash;why, if you really
succeed in getting this fine property, she might make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
very suitable wife for one of your grooms&mdash;ah, ha!&mdash;But
for <i>you</i>&mdash;absurd!"</p>

<p>"Ah! I don't know&mdash;she may be a devilish fine girl,
and the old fellow will have a tolerable penny to leave
her&mdash;and a bird in the hand&mdash;eh? Besides, I know
what she's all along thought&mdash;hem!&mdash;but that doesn't signify."</p>

<p>"Pho! pho! Ridiculous! Ha, ha, ha! Fancy Miss
Tag-rag Mrs. Titmouse! Your eldest son&mdash;ah, ha, ha!
Tag-rag Titmouse, Esq. Delightful! Your honored
father a draper in Oxford Street!" All this might be
very clever, but it did not seem to <i>tell</i> upon Titmouse,
whose little heart had been reached by a cunning hint of
Tag-rag's concerning his daughter's flattering estimate of
Titmouse's personal appearance. The reason why Gammon
attacked so seriously a matter which appeared so
chimerical and preposterous, was this&mdash;that according to
his present plan, Titmouse was to remain for some considerable
while at Tag-rag's, and might, with his utter
weakness of character, be worked upon by Tag-rag and
his daughter, and get inveigled into an engagement which
might be productive hereafter of no little embarrassment.
Gammon succeeded, however, at length, in obtaining Titmouse's
promise to adopt his suggestion, and thereby discover
the true nature of the feelings entertained towards
him at Satin Lodge. He shook Titmouse energetically
by the hand, and left him perfectly certain that if there
was one person in the world worthy of his esteem, and
even reverence, that person was <span class="smcap">Oily Gammon, Esq.</span></p>

<p>As he bent his steps towards Saffron Hill, he reflected
rather anxiously on several matters which had occurred
to him during the interview which I have just described.
On reaching the office, he was presently closeted with Mr.
Quirk, to whom, first and foremost, he exhibited and
delivered the documents to which he had obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Titmouse's signature, and which, the reader will allow me to
assure him, were of a somewhat different texture from a
certain legal instrument or security which I laid before
him some little time ago.</p>

<p>"Now, Gammon," said the old gentleman, as soon as
he had locked up in his safe the above-mentioned
documents&mdash;"Now, Gammon, I think we may be up and at
'em; load our guns, and blaze away," and he rubbed his hands.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, Mr. Quirk," replied Gammon; "but we
must, for no earthly consideration, be premature in our
operations! Let me, by the way, tell you one or two
little matters that have just happened to Titmouse!"&mdash;Then
he told Mr. Quirk of the effects which had followed
the use of the potent Cyanochaitanthropopoion, at which
old Quirk almost laughed himself into fits. When, however,
Gammon, with a serious air, mentioned the name of
Miss Tag-rag, and his grave suspicions concerning her,
Quirk bounced up out of his chair, almost startling Gammon
out of <i>his</i>. If Mr. Quirk had just been told that
his banker had broken, he could scarce have shown more emotion.</p>

<p>The fact was, that he, too, had a <span class="smcap">daughter</span>&mdash;an only
child&mdash;Miss Quirk&mdash;whom he had destined to become Mrs. Titmouse.</p>

<p>"A designing old villain!" he exclaimed at length, and
Gammon agreed with him; but strange to say, with all
his acuteness, never adverted to the real cause of Quirk's
sudden and vehement exclamation. When Gammon told
him of the manner in which he had opened Titmouse's
eyes to the knavery of Tag-rag, and the expedient he had
suggested for its complete demonstration to Titmouse,
Quirk could have worshipped Gammon, and could not
help rising and shaking him very energetically by the
hand, much to his astonishment. After a long consultation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
they determined to look out fresh lodgings for Titmouse,
and remove him presently altogether from the
company and influence of Tag-rag. Some time after they
had parted, Mr. Quirk came with an eager air into Mr.
Gammon's room, with a most important suggestion; viz.
whether it would not be possible for them to get Tag-rag
to <i>become a surety</i> to them, by and by, on behalf of
Titmouse? Gammon was delighted!&mdash;He heartily commended
Mr. Quirk's sagacity, and promised to turn it
about in his thoughts very carefully. Not having been
let entirely into Quirk's policy, (of which the reader has,
however, just had a glimpse,) Mr. Gammon did not see
the difficulties which kept Quirk awake almost all that
night; viz. how to protect Titmouse from the machinations
of Tag-rag and his daughter, and yet keep Tag-rag
sufficiently interested in, and intimate with, Titmouse, to
entertain, by and by, the idea of becoming surety for him
to them, the said Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap;
and&mdash;withal&mdash;how to manage Titmouse all the while, so as
to forward their objects, and also that of turning his attention
towards Miss Quirk; all this formed really rather a
difficult problem!&mdash;Quirk looked down on Tag-rag with
honest indignation, as a mean and mercenary fellow, whose
unprincipled schemes, thank Heaven! he already saw
through, and from which he resolved to rescue his innocent
and confiding client, who was made for better things&mdash;<i>to
wit, Miss Quirk</i>.</p>

<p>When Titmouse rose the next morning, (Saturday,)
behold&mdash;he found his hair had become of a variously
shaded purple or violet color! Astonishment and apprehension
by turns possessed him, as he stared into
the glass, at this unlooked-for change of color; and hastily
dressing himself, after swallowing a very slight breakfast,
off he went once more to the scientific establishment
in Bond Street, to which he had been indebted for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
recent delightful experiences. The distinguished inventor
and proprietor of the Cyanochaitanthropopoion was
behind the counter as usual&mdash;calm and confident as ever.</p>

<p>"Ah! I see&mdash;as I said! as I said!" quoth he, with a
sort of glee in his manner. "Isn't it?&mdash;coming round
quicker than usual&mdash;Really, I'm selling more of the article
than I can possibly make."</p>

<p>"Well,"&mdash;at length said Titmouse, as soon as he had
recovered from the surprise occasioned by the sudden volubility
with which he had been assailed on entering&mdash;"then
<i>is</i> it really going on tolerable well?" taking off
his hat, and looking anxiously into a glass that hung
close by.</p>

<p>"<i>Tolerable</i> well, my dear sir! Delightful! Perfect!
Couldn't be better! If you'd studied the thing, you'd
know, sir, that purple is the middle color between green
and black. Indeed, black's only purple and green mixed,
which explains the whole thing!" Titmouse listened with
infinite satisfaction to this unanswerable and truly philosophical
account of the matter.</p>

<p>"Remember, sir&mdash;my hair is to come like yours&mdash;eh?
you recollect, sir? Honor&mdash;that was the bargain,
you know!"</p>

<p>"I have very little doubt of it, sir&mdash;nay, I am certain
of it, knowing it by experience."</p>

<p>[The scamp had been hired expressly for the purpose
of lying thus in support of the Cyanochaitanthropopoion;
his own hair being a <i>natural</i> black.]</p>

<p>"I'm going to a grand dinner to-morrow, sir," said
Titmouse, "with some devilish great people at the west
end of the town&mdash;eh? you understand? will it do by
that time? Would give a trifle to get my hair a shade
darker by that time&mdash;for&mdash;hem!&mdash;most lovely gal&mdash;eh?
you understand the thing?&mdash;devilish anxious, and all
that sort of thing, you know!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I do," replied the gentleman of the shop, in
a confidential tone; and opening one of the glass doors
behind him, took out a bottle considerably larger than
the first, and handed it to Titmouse. "This," said he,
"will complete the thing; it combines chemically with
the purple particles, and the result is&mdash;generally arrived
at in about two days' time"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"But it will do <i>something</i> in a night's time&mdash;eh!&mdash;surely."</p>

<p>"I should think so! But here it is&mdash;it is called the
<span class="smcap">Tetaragmenon Abracadabra</span>."</p>

<p>"What a name!" exclaimed Titmouse, with a kind
of awe. "'Pon honor, it almost takes one's breath away"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"It will do more, sir; it will take your red hair away!
By the way, only the day before yesterday, a lady of high
rank, (between ourselves, Lady Caroline Carrot,) whose
red hair always seemed as if it would have set her bonnet
in a blaze&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;came here, after two days' use of
the Cyanochaitanthropopoion, and one day's use of this
Tetaragmenon Abracadabra&mdash;and asked me if I knew
her. Upon my soul I did not, till she solemnly assured
me she was really Lady Caroline!"</p>

<p>"<i>How</i> much is it?" eagerly inquired Titmouse, thrusting
his hand into his pocket, with no little excitement.</p>

<p>"Only nine-and-sixpence."</p>

<p>"Oh, my stars, what a price! Nine-and-six"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, but would you have believed it, sir? This extraordinary
fluid cost a great German chemist his whole
life to bring to perfection; and it contains expensive
materials from all the four corners of the world! It's
ruined the proprietor long ago!"</p>

<p>"That may be&mdash;but really&mdash;I've laid out a large
figure with you, sir, this day or two! Couldn't you say
eight sh"&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"We never abate, sir; it's not <i>our</i> style of doing business,"
replied the gentleman, in a manner that quite overawed
poor Titmouse, who at once bought this, the third
abomination; not a little depressed, however, at the heavy
prices which he had paid for the three bottles, and the
uncertainty he felt as to the ultimate issue. That night
he was so well satisfied with the progress which he was
making with his hair, (for, by candle light, it really looked
much darker than could have been expected,) that he
resolved&mdash;at all events for the present&mdash;to leave well
alone; or at the utmost, to try the effects of the Tetaragmenon
Abracadabra only upon his eyebrows and whiskers.
Into them he rubbed the new specific; which, on the
bottle being opened, surprised him in two respects: first,
it was perfectly colorless; secondly, it had a most infernal
smell. It was, however, no use hesitating: he had bought
and paid for it; and the papers in which it was folded
gave an account of its success that was really irresistible
and unquestionable. Away, therefore, he rubbed; and
when he had finished, got into bed, in humble hope as to
the result, which would be disclosed by the morning's
light. But, alas! would you have believed it? When he
looked at himself in the glass, about six o'clock on the
ensuing morning, (at which hour he awoke,) I protest it
is a fact, that his eyebrows and whiskers were as white as
snow; which, combined with the purple color of the hair
on his head, rendered him one of the most astounding objects
(in human shape) the eye of man had ever beheld.
There was the wisdom of age seated in his white eyebrows
and whiskers, unspeakable youthful folly in his features,
and a purple crown of <span class="smcap">wonder</span> on his head.</p>

<p>Really, it seemed as if the devil were wreaking his spite
on Mr. Titmouse; nay, perhaps it was the devil himself
who had served him with the bottles in Bond Street. Or
was it a mere ordinary servant of the devil&mdash;some greedy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
impudent, unprincipled speculator, who, desirous of acting
on the approved maxim&mdash;<i>Fiat experimentum in corpore
vili</i>&mdash;had pitched on Titmouse (seeing the sort of person
he was) as a godsend, quite reckless what effect might be
produced on his hair, so as the stuff were paid for, and
its effects noted? It might possibly have been sport to
the gentleman of the shop, but it was near proving death
to poor Titmouse, who might possibly have resolved on
throwing himself out of the window, only that he saw it
was not big enough for a baby to get through. He turned
aghast at the monstrous object which his little glass presented
to him; and sank down upon the bed with the
feeling that he was now fit for death. As before, Mrs.
Squallop made her appearance with his kettle for breakfast.
He was sitting at the table dressed, and with his
arms folded, with a reckless air, not at all caring to conceal
the new and still more frightful change which he had
undergone since she saw him last. Mrs. Squallop stared
at him for a second or two in silence; then, stepping back
out of the room, suddenly drew to the door, and stood
outside, laughing vehemently.</p>

<p>"I'll kick you down-stairs!" shouted Titmouse, rushing
to the door pale with fury, and pulling it open.</p>

<p>"Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;Titmouse, you'll be the death of me&mdash;you
will&mdash;you will!" gasped Mrs. Squallop, almost black
in the face, and the water running out of the kettle, which
she was unconsciously holding aslant. After a while, however,
they got reconciled. Mrs. Squallop had fancied he
had been but rubbing chalk on his eyebrows and whiskers;
and seemed dismayed, indeed, on hearing the true state
of the case. He implored her to send out for a small
bottle of ink; but as it was Sunday morning none could
be got;&mdash;she knew that no one in the court used ink,
and she teased him to try a little <i>blacking</i>! He did&mdash;but
it was useless!&mdash;He sat for an hour or two, in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
ecstasy of grief and rage. What would he now have given
never to have meddled with the hair which Heaven had
thought fit to send him into the world with? Alas, with
what mournful force Mrs. Squallop's words again and again
recurred to him! To say that he ate breakfast would be
scarcely correct. He drank a single cup of cocoa, and ate
a small fragment of roll, and then put away his breakfast
things on the window shelf. If he had been in the humor
to go to church, how could he? He would have been
turned out as an object involuntarily exciting everybody
to laughter!</p>

<p>Yet, poor soul, in this extremity of misery, he was not
utterly neglected; for he had that morning quite a little
levee. First came Mr. Snap, who, having quite as keen
and clear an eye for his own interest as his senior partners,
had early seen how capable was an acquaintance with
Titmouse of being turned to his (Snap's) great advantage.
He had come, therefore, dressed very stylishly, to do a little
bit of toadying on the sly, (on his own exclusive account;)
and had brought with him, for the edification of Titmouse,
a copy of that day's <i>Sunday Flash</i>, which contained a long
account of a bloody fight between Birmingham Bigbones
and London Littlego, for £500 a-side, (sixty rounds had
been fought, both men killed, and their seconds had
bolted to Boulogne.) Poor Snap, however, though he had
come with the best intentions, and the most anxious wish
to evince profound respect for the future master of ten
thousand a-year, was quite taken by storm by the very
first glimpse he got of Titmouse, and could not for a long
while recover himself. He had come to ask Titmouse to
dine with him at a tavern in the Strand, where there was to
be capital singing in the evening; and also to accompany
him, on the ensuing morning, to the Old Bailey, to hear
"a most interesting trial" for bigamy, in which Snap was
concerned for the prisoner&mdash;a miscreant, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
married to five living women!! Snap conceived (and very
justly) that it would give Titmouse a striking idea of his
(Snap's) importance, to see him so much, and apparently
so <ins title='familarly'>familiarly</ins> concerned with well-known counsel. In his
own terse and quaint way, he was explaining to Titmouse
the various remedies he had against the Bond Street impostor,
both by indictment and action on the case, nay,
(getting a little, however, beyond his depth,) he assured
the eager Titmouse, that a bill of discovery would lie in
equity, to ascertain what the Tetaragmenon Abracadabra
was composed of, with a view to his preferring an indictment
against its owner, when his learned display was
interrupted by a double knock, and&mdash;oh, mercy on us!&mdash;enter
Mr. Gammon. Whether he or Snap felt more
disconcerted, I cannot say; but Snap <i>looked</i> the most
confused and sneaking. Each told the other a lie, in as
easy, good-natured a way as he could assume, concerning
the object of his visit to Titmouse. Thus they were going
on, when&mdash;another knock&mdash;and, "Is this Mr.
Titmouse's?" inquired a voice, which brought a little
color into the face of both Gammon and Snap; for it
was absolutely old Quirk, who bustled breathless into the
room, on his first visit, and seemed completely confounded
by the sight of both his partners. What with this, and
the amazing appearance presented by Titmouse, Mr.
Quirk was so overwhelmed that he scarce spoke a syllable.
Each of the three partners felt (in his own way)
exquisite embarrassment. Huckaback, some time afterwards,
made his appearance; but <i>him</i> Titmouse unceremoniously
dismissed in a twinkling, in spite of a vehement
remonstrance. Behold, however, presently another arrival&mdash;Mr.
Tag-rag!! who had come to announce that
his carriage (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> a queer, rickety, little one-horse chaise,
with a tallow-faced boy in it, in faded livery) was waiting
to convey Mr. Titmouse to Satin Lodge, and take him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
long drive in the country! Each of these four worthies
could have spit in the other's face: first, for <i>detecting</i>,
and secondly, for <i>rivalling</i> him in his schemes upon Titmouse.
A few minutes after the arrival of Tag-rag, Gammon,
half-choked with disgust, and despising himself
even more than he despised his fellow-visitors, slunk off,
followed almost immediately by Quirk, who was dying to
consult him on this new aspect of affairs which had presented
itself. Snap (who ever since the arrival of Messrs.
Quirk and Gammon had felt like an ape on hot irons)
very shortly followed in the footsteps of his partners,
having made no engagement whatever with Titmouse;
and thus the enterprising and determined Tag-rag was
left master of the field. He had in fact come to <i>do business</i>,
and business he determined to do. As for Gammon,
during the short time he had stayed, how he had endeared
himself to Titmouse, by explaining, not aware that
Titmouse had confessed all to Snap, the singular change in
the color of his hair to have been occasioned simply by
the intense mental anxiety through which he had lately
passed! The touching anecdotes he told of sufferers,
whose hair a single night's agony had changed to all the
colors of the rainbow! Though Tag-rag outstayed all
his fellow-visitors, in the manner which has been described,
he could not prevail upon Titmouse to accompany
him in his "carriage," for Titmouse pleaded a pressing
engagement, (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> a desperate attempt he purposed making
to obtain some <i>ink</i>,) but pledged himself to make his
appearance at Satin Lodge at the appointed hour (half-past
three or four o'clock.) Away, therefore, drove Tag-rag,
delighted that Satin Lodge would so soon contain so
resplendent a visitor&mdash;indignant at the cringing, sycophantic
attentions of Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap,
against whom he resolved to put Titmouse on his guard,
and infinitely astonished at the extraordinary change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
which had taken place in the color of Titmouse's hair.
Partly influenced by the explanation which Gammon had
given of the phenomenon, Tag-rag resigned himself to
feelings of simple wonder. Titmouse was doubtless passing
through stages of physical transmogrification, corresponding
with the marvellous change that was taking
place in his circumstances; and for all he (Tag-rag) knew,
other and more extraordinary changes were going on;
Titmouse might be growing at the rate of half an inch
a-day, and soon stand before him a man more than six
feet high! Considerations such as these invested Titmouse
with intense and overpowering interest in the
estimation of Tag-rag; <i>how</i> could he make enough of him
at Satin Lodge that day? If ever that hardened sinner
felt inclined to utter an inward prayer, it was as he drove
home that day&mdash;that Heaven would array his daughter
in angel hues to the eyes of Titmouse!</p>

<p>My friend Tittlebat made his appearance at the gate
of Satin Lodge, at about a quarter to four o'clock. Good
gracious, how he had dressed himself out! So as very
considerably to exceed his appearance when first presented
to the reader.</p>

<p>Miss Tag-rag had been before her glass ever since the
instant of her return from chapel, up to within ten minutes'
time of Titmouse's arrival. An hour and a half at
least had she bestowed on her hair, disposing it in little
corkscrew and somewhat scanty curls, which quite glistened
in bear's grease, hanging on each side of a pair of
lean and sallow cheeks. The color which ought to have
distributed itself over her cheeks, in roseate delicacy, had,
two or three years before, thought fit to collect itself into
the tip of her sharp little nose. Her small gray eyes
beamed with the gentle and attractive expression perceptible
in her father's; and her projecting under lip reminded
everybody of that delicate feature in her mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
She was very short, and her figure rather skinny and angular.
She wore her lilac-colored frock; her waist being
pinched in to a degree which made you think of a fit of
the colic when you looked at her&mdash;and gave you a dim
vision of a coroner's inquest on a case of death by tight lacing!
A long red sash, tied in a most elaborate bow, gave
a very brilliant air to her dress generally. She had a thin
gold chain round her neck, and wore long white gloves; her
left hand holding her pocket-handkerchief, which she had
so suffused with bergamot that it scented the whole room.
Mrs. Tag-rag had made herself very splendid, in a red silk
gown and staring head-dress; in fact, she seemed <i>on fire</i>.
As for Mr. Tag-rag, whenever he was dressed in his Sunday
clothes, he looked the model of a dissenting minister;
witness his black coat, waistcoat and trousers, and primly
tied white neckerchief, with no shirt-collar visible. For
some quarter of an hour had this interesting trio been
standing at their parlor window, in anxious expectation
of Titmouse's arrival; their only amusement being the
numberless dusty stage-coaches driving every five minutes
close past their gate, (which was about ten yards from
their house,) at once enlivening and ruralizing the scene.
Oh, that poor laburnum&mdash;laden with dust, drooping with
drought, and evidently in the very last stage of a decline&mdash;that
was planted beside the little gate! Tag-rag spoke
of cutting it down; but Mrs. and Miss Tag-rag begged its
life a little longer, because none of their neighbors had
one!&mdash;and then <i>that</i> subject dropped. How was it that
though both the ladies had sat under a thundering discourse
from Mr. Dismal Horror that morning&mdash;they had
never once since thought or spoken of him or his sermon&mdash;never
even opened his exhilarating "<i>Groans</i>"? The
reason was plain. They thought of Titmouse, who was
bringing "airs from heaven;" while Horror brought
only "blasts from&mdash;&mdash;!" and <i>those</i> they had every day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
in the week, (his sermons on the Sunday, his "<i>Groans</i>"
on the weekday.) At length Miss Tag-rag's little heart
fluttered violently, for her papa told her that Titmouse
was coming up the road&mdash;and so he was. Not dreaming
that he could be seen, he stood beside the gate for a
moment, under the melancholy laburnum; and, taking a
dirty-looking silk handkerchief out of his hat, slapped it
vigorously about his boots, (from which circumstance it
may be inferred that he had walked,) and replaced it in his
hat. Then he unbuttoned his surtout, adjusted it nicely,
and disposed his chain and eyeglass just so as to let the
tip only of the latter be seen peeping out of his waistcoat;
twitched up his shirt-collar, plucked down his wristbands,
drew the tip of a white pocket handkerchief out of the
pocket in the breast of his surtout, pulled a white glove
halfway on his left hand; and having thus given the finishing
touches to his toilet, opened the gate, and&mdash;Tittlebat
Titmouse, Esquire, the great guest of the day, for the first
time in his life (swinging a little ebony cane about with
careless grace) entered the domain of Mr. Tag-rag.</p>

<p>The little performance I have been describing, though
every bit of it passing under the eyes of Tag-rag, his wife,
and his daughter, had not excited a smile; their anxious
feelings were too deep to be reached or stirred by light
emotions. Miss Tag-rag turned very pale and trembled.</p>

<p>"La, pa!" said she, faintly, "how could you say he'd
got white eyebrows and whiskers? Why&mdash;they're a
beautiful <i>black</i>!"</p>

<p>Tag-rag was speechless: the fact was so&mdash;for Titmouse
had fortunately succeeded in obtaining a little bottle of
ink, which he had applied with great effect. As Titmouse
approached the house, (Tag-rag hurrying out to open the
door for him,) he saw the two ladies standing at the windows.
Off went his hat, and out dropped the dusty silk
handkerchief, not a little disconcerting him for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
moment. Tag-rag, however, soon occupied his attention at
the door with anxious civilities, shaking him by the hand,
hanging up his hat and stick for him, and then introducing
him to the sitting-room. The ladies received him
with the most profound courtesies, which Titmouse returned
with a quick embarrassed bow, and an indistinct&mdash;"Hope
you're well, mem?"</p>

<p>If they had had presence of mind enough to observe it,
the purple color of Titmouse's hair must have surprised
them not a little; all <i>they</i> could see standing before them,
however, was&mdash;the angelic owner of ten thousand a-year.</p>

<p>The only person tolerably at his ease, and he <i>only</i> tolerably,
was Mr. Tag-rag; and he asked his guest&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wash your hands, Titmouse, before dinner?" But
Titmouse said he had washed them before he had come
out. [The day was hot, and he had walked five miles at
a slapping pace.] In a few minutes, however, he felt a
little more assured; it being impossible for him not to
perceive the awful deference with which he was treated.</p>

<p>"Seen the <i>Sunday Flash</i>, mem?" he presently inquired,
very modestly, addressing Mrs. Tag-rag.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;that is&mdash;not <i>to-day</i>," she replied, coloring.</p>

<p>"Vastly amusing, isn't it?" interposed Tag-rag, to
prevent mischief&mdash;for he knew his wife would as soon
have taken a cockatrice into her hand.</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;e&mdash;s," replied Titmouse, who had not even
glanced at the copy which Snap had brought him. "An
uncommon good fight between Birmingham Big"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Tag-rag saw his wife getting redder and redder. "No
news stirring about things in general, is there?" said he,
with a desperate attempt at a diversion.</p>

<p>"Not that I have heard," replied Titmouse. Soon he
got a little farther, and said how cheerful the stages going
past must make the house. Tag-rag agreed with him.
Then there was a little pause. None of the party knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
exactly which way to look, nor in what posture to sit.
Faint "hems" were occasionally heard. In short, no one
felt <i>at home</i>.</p>

<p>"Been to church, mem, this morning, mem?" timidly
inquired Titmouse of Miss Tag-rag&mdash;the first time of his
daring to address her.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," she replied, faintly coloring, casting her
eyes to the ground, and suddenly putting her hand into
that of her mother&mdash;with <i>such</i> an innocent, engaging
simplicity&mdash;like a timid fawn lying as close as possible
to its dam![<a href='#Note_13'>13</a>]</p>

<p>"We always go to <i>chapel</i>, sir," said Mrs. Tag-rag, confidently,
in spite of a deadly look from her husband; "the
<i>gospel</i> a'n't preached in the Church of England! We sit
under Mr. Horror&mdash;a heavenly preacher! You've heard
of Mr. Horror?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mem! Oh, yes! Capital preacher!" replied
Titmouse, who of course (being a true churchman) had
never in his life heard of Mr. Horror, or any other dissenter.</p>

<p>"When <i>will</i> dinner be ready, Mrs. T.?" inquired Tag-rag,
abruptly, and with a very perceptible dash of sternness
in his tone; but dinner was announced the very next
moment. He took his wife's arm, and in doing so, gave
it a sudden vehement pressure, which, coupled with a furious
glance, explained to her the extent to which she had
incurred his anger!</p>

<p>Titmouse's offered arm the timid Miss Tag-rag scarcely
touched with the tip of her finger, as she walked beside
him to dinner. He soon got tolerably composed and
cheerful at dinner, (which, contrary to their usual custom&mdash;which
was to have a cheerless <i>cold</i> dinner on the
Sabbath&mdash;consisted of a little piece of nice roast beef,
with plenty of horse-radish, Yorkshire pudding, a boiled
fowl, a plum-pudding made by Mrs. Tag-rag, and custards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
which had been superintended by Miss Tag-rag herself,)
and, to oblige his hospitable host and hostess, ate till he
was near bursting. Miss Tag-rag, though really very hungry,
could be prevailed upon to take only a very small
slice of beef and a quarter of a custard, and drank a third
of a glass of quasi sherry (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Cape wine) after dinner.
She never once spoke, except in hurried answers, to her
papa and mamma; and sitting exactly opposite Titmouse,
(with a big plate of greens and a boiled fowl between
them,) was continually coloring whenever their eyes happened
to encounter one another, on which occasions, hers
would suddenly drop, as if overpowered by the brilliance of
his. Titmouse began to love her very fast. After the
ladies had withdrawn, you should have heard the way in
which Tag-rag went on with Titmouse!&mdash;I can liken the
two to nothing but an old fat spider and a little fly.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Will you come into my parlor?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said the spider to the fly;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;in the old song: and it might have been well for Titmouse
to have answered, in the language of the aforesaid fly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No, thank you, sir, I really feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No curiosity."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Titmouse, however, swallowed with equal facility Mr.
Tag-rag's hard port and his soft blarney; but <i>all</i> fools
have large swallows. When, at length, Tag-rag with exquisite
skill and delicacy alluded to the painfully evident
embarrassment of his "poor Tabby," and said he had "all
of a sudden found out what had been so long the matter
with her," [ay, even this went down,] and hemmed, and
winked his eye, and drained his glass, Titmouse began to
get flustered, blushed, and hoped Mr. Tag-rag would soon
"join the ladies." They did so, Tag-rag stopping behind
for a few moments to lock up the wine and the remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of the fruit, not wishing to subject the servant-boy to
temptation by the rare opportunity afforded by fruit left
on the table. Miss Tag-rag presided over the tea-things.
There were muffins, and crumpets, and reeking-hot buttered
toast; and hospitable Mrs. Tag-rag would hear of
no denial, "things had been <i>got</i>, and must be <i>eat</i>," she
thought within herself; so poor Titmouse, after a most
desperate resistance, was obliged to swallow a round of
toast, half a muffin, an entire crumpet, and four cups of
hot tea; after which <i>they</i> felt that <i>he</i> must feel comfortable;
but he, alas, in fact, experienced a very painful degree
of turgidity, and a miserable conviction that he
should be able neither to eat nor drink anything more
for the remainder of the week!</p>

<p>After the tea-things had been removed, Tag-rag, directing
Titmouse's attention to the piano, which was open,
(with some music on it, ready to be played from,) asked
him whether he liked music. Titmouse, with great eagerness,
hoped Miss T. would give them some music; and
she, after holding out a long and vigorous siege, at length
asked her papa what it should be.</p>

<p>"<i>The Battle of Prague</i>," said her papa.</p>

<p>"<i>Before Jehovah's awful throne</i>, my dear!" hastily and
anxiously interposed her mamma.</p>

<p>"The Battle," sternly repeated her papa.</p>

<p>"It's Sunday night, Mr. T.," meekly rejoined his wife.</p>

<p>"Which will you have, Mr. Titmouse?" inquired Tag-rag,
with <i>The Battle of Prague</i> written in every feature
of his face. Titmouse almost burst into a state of perspiration.</p>

<p>"A little of both, sir, if you please."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Tag-rag, slightly relaxing, "that will
do. Split the difference&mdash;eh? Come, Tab, down with
you. Titmouse, will you turn over the music for my
little girl?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>Titmouse rose, and having sheepishly taken his station
beside Miss Tag-rag, the performances commenced with
<i>Before Jehovah's awful throne</i>! But mercy upon us! at
what a rate she rattled over that "pious air!" If its
respectable composer (whoever he may be) had been
present, he must have gone into a fit; but there was no
help for it&mdash;the heart of the lovely performer was in <i>The
Battle of Prague</i>, to which she presently did most ample
justice. So much were her feelings engaged in that sublime
composition, that the bursting of one of the strings&mdash;twang!
in the middle of the "<i>cannonading</i>" did not
at all disturb her; and, as soon as she had finished the
exquisite "finale," Titmouse was in such a tumult of excitement,
from a variety of causes, that he could have
shed tears. Though he had never once turned over at
the right place, Miss Tag-rag thanked him for his services
with a smile of infinite sweetness. Titmouse vowed he
had never heard such splendid music&mdash;begged for more:
and away went Miss Tag-rag, hurried away by her excitement.
Rondo after rondo, march after march, she rattled
over for at least half an hour upon those hideous jingling
keys; at the end of which old Tag-rag suddenly kissed
her with passionate fondness. Though Mrs. Tag-rag was
horrified at the impiety of all this, she kept a very anxious
eye on the young couple, and interchanged with her
husband, every now and then, very significant looks.
Shortly after nine, spirits, wine, and hot and cold water,
were brought in. At the sight of them Titmouse looked
alarmed&mdash;for he knew that he must take something
more, though he would have freely given five shillings to
be excused&mdash;for he felt as if he could not hold another
drop! But it was in vain. <i>Willy-nilly</i>, a glass of gin
and water stood soon before him; he protested he could
not touch it unless Miss Tag-rag would "take something"&mdash;whereupon,
with a blush, she "thought she <i>would</i>"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
take a wine-glassful of sherry and water. This was provided
her. Then Tag-rag mixed a tumbler of port-wine
negus for Mrs. Tag-rag, and a great glass of mahogany-colored
brandy and water for himself; and then he
looked round the elegant little apartment, and felt perfectly
happy. As Titmouse advanced with his gin and
water, his spirits got higher and higher, and his tongue
more fluent. He once or twice dropped the "Mr." when
addressing Tag-rag; several times smiled, and once even
winked at the embarrassed Miss Tag-rag. Mr. Tag-rag
saw it, and could not control himself&mdash;for he had got to
the end of his first glass of brandy and water, and (a
most unusual procedure with <i>him</i>) mixed himself a second
quite <i>as</i> strong as the former.</p>

<p>"Tab! ah, Tab! what <i>has</i> been the matter with you
all these months?" said he, chucking her under the chin&mdash;and
then he winked his eye at her and then at Titmouse.</p>

<p>"Papa!" exclaimed Miss Tag-rag, looking down, and
blushing up to her very temples.</p>

<p>"Ah, Titmouse&mdash;Titmouse&mdash;give me your hand," said
Tag-rag; "you'll forget us all when you're a great man&mdash;but
we shall always remember you!"</p>

<p>"You're very good&mdash;very!" said Titmouse, cordially
returning the pressure of Tag-rag's hand. At that instant
it suddenly occurred to him to adopt the suggestion
of Mr. Gammon. Tag-rag was going on very fast,
indeed, about the disinterested nature of his feelings towards
Titmouse; towards whom, he said, he had always
felt just as he did at that moment&mdash;'twas in vain to deny it.</p>

<p>"I'm sure your conduct shows it, sir," commenced Titmouse,
feeling a shudder like that with which a timid
bather approaches the margin of the cold stream. "I
could have taken my oath, sir, that when you had heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
what has happened, you would have refused to let me
come into your house!"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!&mdash;that's <i>rather</i> an odd idea, too!" said Tag-rag,
with good-humored jocularity. "If I felt a true
friendship for you as plain Titmouse, it's so likely I
should have <i>cut</i> you just when&mdash;ahem! My dear sir!
It was <i>I</i> that thought <i>you</i> wouldn't have come into <i>my</i>
house! A likely thing, indeed!"</p>

<p>Titmouse was puzzled. His perceptions, never very
quick or clear, were now undoubtedly somewhat obfuscated
with what he had been drinking. In short, he did
not understand that Tag-rag had not understood <i>him</i>;
and felt rather baffled.</p>

<p>"What surprising ups and downs there are in life, Mr.
Titmouse!" said Mrs. Tag-rag, respectfully&mdash;"they're
all sent from above, you may depend upon it, to <i>try</i> us!
No one knows how they'd behave, if as how (in a manner)
they were turned upside down."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I hope, mem, I haven't done anything to show
that <i>I</i>"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! my dear Titmouse," anxiously interrupted Tag-rag,
inwardly cursing his wife, who, finding she always
went wrong in her husband's eyes whenever she spoke a
word, determined for the future to stick to her negus&mdash;"The
fact is, there's a Mr. Horror here that's for sending
all decent people to&mdash;&mdash;. He's filled my wife there
with all sorts of&mdash;&mdash; nay, if she isn't bursting with cant&mdash;so
never mind her! <i>You</i> done anything wrong! I
<i>will</i> say this for you&mdash;you always was a pattern of modesty
and propriety&mdash;your hand, my dear Titmouse!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I'm a happy man again," resumed Titmouse,
resolved now to go on with his adventure. "And when
did they tell you of it, sir?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a few days ago&mdash;a week ago," replied Tag-rag, trying
to recollect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;sir&mdash;a'n't you mistaken?" inquired
Titmouse, with a depressed, but at the same time a surprised
air. "It only happened this morning, after you left"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Eh?&mdash;eh?&mdash;ah, ha!&mdash;What <i>do</i> you mean, Mr. Titmouse?"
interrupted Tag-rag, with a faint attempt at a
smile. Mrs. Tag-rag and Miss Tag-rag also turned exceedingly
startled faces towards Titmouse, who felt as if
a house were going to fall down on him.</p>

<p>"Why, sir," he began to cry, (an attempt which was
greatly aided by the maudlin condition to which drink
had reduced him,) "till to-day, I thought I was heir to
ten thousand a-year, and it seems I'm not; it's all a mistake
of those cursed people at Saffron Hill!"</p>

<p>Tag-rag's face changed visibly, and showed the desperate
shock he had just sustained. His inward agony was forcing
out on his slanting forehead a dew of perspiration.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;a&mdash;capital&mdash;joke&mdash;Mr.&mdash;Titmouse&mdash;ah,
ha!"&mdash;he gasped, hastily passing his handkerchief over
his forehead. Titmouse, though greatly alarmed, stood
to his gun pretty steadily.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wish it was a joke! It's been no joke to <i>me</i>,
sir. There's another Tittlebat Titmouse, it seems, in
Shoreditch, that's the right"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who told you this, sir? Pho, I don't&mdash;I can't believe
it," said Tag-rag, in a voice tremulous between suppressed
rage and fear.</p>

<p>"Too true, though, 'pon my life! It <i>is</i>, so help me&mdash;&mdash;!"
in the most earnest and solemn manner.</p>

<p>"How dare you swear before ladies, sir? You're insulting
them, sir!" cried Tag-rag, trembling with rage.
"And in <i>my</i> presence, too, sir? You're not a gentleman!"
He suddenly dropped his voice, and in a trembling and
almost beseeching manner, asked Titmouse whether he
was really joking or serious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never more serious in my life, sir; and enough to
make me so, sir!" replied Titmouse, in a lamentable
manner.</p>

<p>"You really mean, then, to tell me it's all a mistake,
then&mdash;and that you're no more than what you always
were?" inquired Tag-rag, with a desperate attempt to
speak calmly.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir! Yes!" cried Titmouse, mournfully;
"and if you'll only be so kind as to let me serve you as
I used&mdash;I'll serve you faithfully! You know it was no
fault of <i>mine</i>, sir! They <i>would</i> tell me it was so!"</p>

<p>'Tis impossible to conceive a more disgusting expression
than the repulsive features of Tag-rag wore at that
moment, while he gazed in ominous and agitated silence
at Titmouse. His lips quivered, and he seemed incapable
of speaking.</p>

<p>"Oh, ma, I do feel <i>so</i> ill!" faintly exclaimed Miss Tag-rag,
turning deadly pale. Titmouse was on the verge of
dropping on his knees and confessing the trick, greatly
agitated at the effect unexpectedly produced on Miss Tag-rag;
when Tag-rag's heavy hand was suddenly placed on
his shoulder, and he whispered in a fierce undertone&mdash;"You're
an impostor, sir!" which arrested Titmouse,
and made something like a <span class="smcap">man</span> of him. He was a fearful
fool, but he did not want for mere <i>pluck</i>; and now it
was roused. Mrs. Tag-rag exclaimed, "Oh, you <i>shocking</i>
scamp!" as she passed Titmouse, with much agitation,
and led her daughter out of the room.</p>

<p>"Then an impostor, sir, a'n't fit company for <i>you</i>, of
course, sir!" said Titmouse, rising, and trembling with
mingled apprehension and anger.</p>

<p>"Pay me my five-pound note!" almost shouted Tag-rag,
furiously tightening the grasp by which he held
Titmouse's collar.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, and I will, if you'll only take your hand off!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Hollo, sir&mdash;What the de&mdash;&mdash; Leave go, sir! Hands off!
Are you going to murder me? I'll pay you, and done
with you, sir," stammered Titmouse:&mdash;when a faint
scream was heard, plainly from Miss Tag-rag, overhead,
and in hysterics. Then the seething caldron boiled over.
"You <i>infernal</i> scoundrel!" exclaimed Tag-rag, almost
choked with fury; and suddenly seizing Titmouse by the
collar, scarce giving him time, in passing, to get hold of
his hat and stick, he urged him along through the passage,
down the gravel walk, threw open the gate, thrust
him furiously through it, and sent after him such a blast
of execration, as was almost strong enough to drive him
a hundred yards down the road! Titmouse did not fully
recover his breath or his senses for a long while afterwards.
When he did, the first thing he experienced, was
a dreadful disposition towards sickness; but gradually
overcoming it, he felt an inclination to fall down on his
knees in the open road, and worship the sagacious and
admirable <span class="smcap">Gammon</span>, who had so exactly predicted what
had come to pass!</p>

<p>And now, Mr. Titmouse, for some little time I have
done with you. Away!&mdash;give room to your betters.
But don't think that I have yet "rifled <i>all</i> your sweetness,"
or am <i>yet</i> about to "fling you like a noisome weed away."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p>While the lofty door of a house in Grosvenor Street was
yet quivering under the shock of a previously announced
dinner-arrival, one of the two servants standing behind a
carriage which approached from the direction of Piccadilly,
slipped off, and in a twinkling, with a thun-thun-thunder-under-under,
thunder-runder-runder, thun-thun-thun!
and a shrill thrilling <i>Whir-r-r</i> of the bell, announced
the arrival of the Duke of&mdash;&mdash;, the last guest. It was a
large and plain carriage, but perfectly well known; and
before the door of the house at which it had drawn up
had been opened, displaying some four or five servants
standing in the hall, in simple but elegant liveries, some
half-dozen passengers had stopped to see get out of the
carriage an elderly, middle-sized man, with a somewhat
spare figure, dressed in plain black clothes, with iron-gray
hair, and a countenance which, once seen, was not to be
forgotten. That was a great man; one, the like of whom
many previous centuries had not seen; whose name shot
terror into the hearts of all the enemies of old England
all over the world, and fond pride and admiration into
the hearts of his fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>"A quarter to eleven!" he said, in a quiet tone, to the
servant who was holding open the carriage door&mdash;while
the bystanders took off their hats; a courtesy which he
acknowledged, as he slowly stepped across the pavement,
by touching his hat in a mechanical sort of way with his
forefinger. The house-door then closed upon him; the
handful of onlookers passed away; off rolled the empty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
carriage, and all without was quiet as before. The house
was that of Mr. Aubrey, one of the members for the borough
of <span class="smcap">Yatton</span>, in Yorkshire&mdash;a man of rapidly rising
importance in Parliament. Surely his was a pleasant
position&mdash;that of an independent country gentleman, a
member of one of the most ancient noble families in England,
with a clear unencumbered rent-roll of ten thousand
a-year, and already, in only his thirty-fourth year, the
spokesman of his class, and promising to become one of
the ablest debaters in the House! Parliament having
been assembled, in consequence of a particular emergency,
at a much earlier period than usual, the House of Commons,
in which Mr. Aubrey had the evening before delivered
a well-timed and powerful speech, had adjourned
for the Christmas recess, the House of Lords being about
to follow its example that evening: an important division,
however, being first expected to take place at a late
hour. Mr. Aubrey was warmly complimented on his
success by several of the select and brilliant circle then
assembled; and who were all in high spirits&mdash;on account
of a considerable triumph just obtained by their party,
and to which Mr. Aubrey was assured, by even the Duke
of&mdash;&mdash;, his exertions had certainly not a little contributed.
While his Grace was energetically intimating to
Mr. Aubrey his opinion to this effect, there were two
lovely women listening to him with intense eagerness&mdash;they
were the wife and sister of Mr. Aubrey. The former
was a very interesting and handsome woman&mdash;with
raven hair, and a complexion of dazzling fairness&mdash;of
nearly eight-and-twenty; the latter was a very beautiful
girl, somewhere between twenty and twenty-one. Both
were dressed with the utmost simplicity and elegance.
Mrs. Aubrey, most dotingly fond of her husband, and a
blooming young mother of two as charming children as
were to be met with in a day's walk all over both the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
parks, was, in character and manners, all pliancy and
gentleness; while about Miss Aubrey there was a dash
of spirit which gave an infinite zest to her beauty. Her
blue eyes beamed with the richest expression of feeling&mdash;in
short, Catherine Aubrey was, both in face and figure,
a downright English beauty; and she knew&mdash;truth
must be told&mdash;that such she appeared to the Great
Duke, whose cold aquiline eye she often <i>felt</i> to be settled
upon her with satisfaction. The fact was that he had
penetrated at a first glance beneath the mere surface of
an arch, sweet, and winning manner, and detected a certain
strength of character in Miss Aubrey which gave
him more than usual interest in her, and spread over his
iron-cast features a pleasant expression, relaxing their
sternness. It might indeed be said, that before her, in
his person,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Grim-visaged war had smooth'd his wrinkled front."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'Twas a subject for a painter, that delicate and blooming
girl, her auburn hair hanging in careless grace on
each side of her white forehead, while her eyes,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That might have sooth'd a tiger's rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or thaw'd the cold heart of a conqueror,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>were fixed with absorbed interest on the stern and rigid
countenance which she reflected had been, as it were, a
thousand times darkened with the smoke of the grisly
battle-field. But I must not forget that there are others
in the room; and among them, standing at a little distance,
is Lord De la Zouch, one of Mr. Aubrey's neighbors
in Yorkshire. Apparently he is listening to a brother
peer talking to him very earnestly about the expected
division; but Lord De la Zouch's eye is fixed on you,
lovely Kate&mdash;and how little can you imagine what is
passing through his mind! It has just occurred to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
that his sudden arrangement for young Delamere&mdash;his
only son and heir, come up the day before from Oxford&mdash;to
call for him about half-past ten, and take his place in
Mrs. Aubrey's drawing-room, while Lord De la Zouch
goes down to the House&mdash;may be attended with certain
consequences! He is in truth speculating on the effect
of your beauty bursting suddenly on his son&mdash;who has
not seen you for nearly two years! all this gives him
anxiety&mdash;but not painful anxiety&mdash;for, dear Kate, he
knows that your forehead would wear the ancient coronet
of the De la Zouches with grace and dignity. But Delamere
is as yet too young&mdash;and if he gets the image of
Catherine Aubrey into his head, it will, fears his father,
instantly cast into the shade and displace all the stern
visages of those old geometers, poets, orators, historians,
philosophers, and statesmen, who ought, in Lord De la
Zouch's and his son's tutor's judgment, to occupy exclusively
the head of the aforesaid Delamere for some five
years to come. That youngster&mdash;happy fellow!&mdash;frank,
high-spirited, and enthusiastic&mdash;and handsome to
boot&mdash;was heir to an ancient title and very great estates;
all that his father had considered in looking out
for an alliance was&mdash;youth, health, beauty, blood&mdash;here
they all were;&mdash;and <i>fortune</i> too&mdash;bah! what did it
signify to his son&mdash;but at any rate 'twas not to be
thought of for some years.</p>

<p>"Suppose," said he, aloud, though in a musing manner,
"one were to say&mdash;twenty-four"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Twenty-four!</i>" echoed his companion, with amazement;
"my dear De la Zouch, what the deuce do you mean?
<i>Eighty</i>-four at the very lowest!"</p>

<p>"Eh? what? oh&mdash;yes of course&mdash;I should say ninety&mdash;I
mean&mdash;hem!&mdash;<i>they</i> will muster about twenty-four only."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;I beg your pardon!&mdash;<i>there</i> you're right, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
dare say."&mdash;Here the announcement of dinner put an
end to the colloquy of the two statesmen. Lord De la
Zouch led down Miss Aubrey with an air of the most
delicate and cordial courtesy; and felt almost disposed,
in the heat of the moment, to tell her that he had arranged
all in his own mind&mdash;that if <i>she</i> willed it, she had
<i>his</i> hearty consent to become the future Lady De la Zouch.
He was himself the eleventh who had come to the title in
direct descent from father to son; 'twas a point he was
not a little nervous and anxious about&mdash;he detested collateral
succession&mdash;and he made himself infinitely agreeable
to Miss Aubrey as he sat beside her at dinner! The
Duke of&mdash;&mdash; sat on the right hand side of Mrs. Aubrey,
seemingly in high spirits, and she appeared proud enough
of her supporter. It was a delightful dinner-party, elegant
without ostentation, and select without pretence of exclusiveness.
All were cheerful and animated, not merely on
account of the over-night's parliamentary victory, which
I have already alluded to, but also in contemplation of
the coming Christmas; how, and where, and with whom
each was to spend that "righte merrie season," being the
chief topic of conversation. As there was nothing peculiar
in the dinner, and as I have no turn for describing
such matters in detail&mdash;the clatter of plate, the jingling
of silver, the sparkling of wines, and so forth&mdash;I shall
request the reader to imagine himself led by me quietly
out of the dining-room into the library&mdash;thus escaping
from all the bustle and hubbub attendant upon such an
entertainment as is going on in front of the house. We
shall be alone in the library&mdash;here it is; we enter it, and
shut the door. 'Tis a spacious room, all the sides covered
with books, of which Mr. Aubrey is a great collector&mdash;and
the clear red fire (which we must presently replenish,
or it will go out) is shedding a subdued ruddy light on
all the objects in the room, very favorable for our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
purpose. The ample table is covered with books and papers;
and there is an antique-looking arm-chair drawn opposite
to the fire, in which Mr. Aubrey has been indulging in a
long revery till the moment of quitting it to go and dress
for dinner. This chair I shall sit in myself; you may
draw out from the recess for yourself one of two little
sloping easy-chairs, which have been placed there by Mrs.
and Miss Aubrey for their own sole use, considering that
they are excellent judges of the period at which Mr. Aubrey
has been long enough alone, and at which they
should come in and gossip with him. We may as well
draw the dusky green curtains across the window, through
which the moon shines at present rather too brightly.&mdash;So
now, after coaxing up the fire, I will proceed to tell
you a little bit of pleasant family history.</p>

<p>The Aubreys are a Yorkshire family&mdash;the younger
branch of the ancient and noble family of the Dreddlingtons.
Their residence, <span class="smcap">Yatton</span>, is in the north-eastern
part of the county, not above fifteen or twenty miles from
the sea. The hall is one of those old structures, the sight
of which throws you back a couple of centuries in our
English history. It stands in a park, crowded with trees,
many of them of great age and size, and under which two
or three hundred head of deer perform their capricious
and graceful gambols. In approaching from London, you
strike off from the great north road into a broad by-way;
after going down which for about a mile, you come to a
straggling little village called Yatton, at the farther extremity
of which stands a little aged gray church, with
a tall thin spire; an immense yew-tree, with a kind of
friendly gloom, overshadowing, in the little churchyard,
nearly half the graves. Rather in the rear of the church
is the vicarage-house, snug and sheltered by a line of fir-trees.
After walking on about eighty yards, you come
to high park-gates, and see a lodge just within, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
left hand side, sheltered by an elm-tree. Having passed
through these gates, you wind your way for about two-thirds
of a mile along a gravel walk, among the thickening
trees, till you come to a ponderous old crumbling
looking red brick gateway of the time of Henry VII.,
with one or two deeply set stone windows in the turrets,
and mouldering stone-capped battlements peeping through
high-climbing ivy. There is an old escutcheon immediately
over the point of the arch; and as you pass underneath,
if you look up, you can plainly see the groove of
the old portcullis still remaining. Having passed under
this castellated remnant, you enter a kind of court formed
by a high wall completely covered with ivy, running along
in a line from the right hand turret of the gateway till it
joins the house. Along its course are a number of yew-trees.
In the centre of the open space is a quaintly
disposed grass-plot, dotted about with stunted box, and
in the centre of that stands a weather-beaten stone sundial.</p>

<p>The house itself is a large irregular pile of dull red
brickwork, with great stacks of chimneys in the rear; the
body of the building has evidently been erected at different
times. Some part is evidently in the style of Queen
Elizabeth's reign, another in that of Queen Anne; and it
is plain that on the site of the present structure has formerly
stood a castle. There are, indeed, traces of the old
moat still visible round the rear of the house. One of the
ancient towers, with small deep stone windows, still remains,
giving its venerable support to the right hand extremity
of the building, as you stand with your face to
the door. The long frontage of the house consists of two
huge masses of dusky-red brickwork, (you can hardly call
them <i>wings</i>,) connected together by a lower building in
the centre, which contains the hall. There are three or
four rows of long thin deep windows, with heavy-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
wooden sashes. The high-pitched roof is of red tiles, and
has deep projecting eaves, forming, in fact, a bold wooden
cornice running along the whole length of the building,
which is some two or three stories high. At the left extremity
stands a clump of ancient cedars of Lebanon,
feathering in evergreen beauty down to the ground. The
hall is large and lofty; the floor is of polished oak, almost
the whole of which is covered with thick matting; it is
wainscoted all round with black oak; some seven or eight
full-length pictures, evidently of considerable antiquity,
being let into the panels. Quaint figures these are to be
sure; and if they resembled the ancestors of the Aubrey
family, those ancestors must have been singular and startling
persons! The faces are quite white and staring&mdash;all
as if in wonder; and they have such long thin legs!
some of them ending in sharp-pointed shoes. On each
side of the ample fireplace stands a figure in full armor;
and there are also ranged along the wall old helmets, cuirasses,
swords, lances, battle-axes, and cross-bows, the very
idea of wearing, wielding, and handling which, makes your
arms ache, while you exclaim, "they <i>must</i> have been giants
in those days!" On one side of this hall, a door opens
into the dining-room, beyond which is the library; on the
other side a door leads you into a noble room, now called
the drawing-room, where stands a very fine organ. Out
of both the dining-room and drawing-room you pass up a
staircase contained in an old square tower; two sides of
each of them, opening on the quadrangle, lead into a gallery
running round it, and into which all the bed-rooms open.</p>

<p>But I need not go into further detail. Altogether it is
truly a fine old mansion. Its only constant occupant is
Mrs. Aubrey, the mother of Mr. Aubrey, in whose library
we are now seated. She is a widow, having survived her
husband, who twice was one of the county members, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
fifteen years. Mr. Aubrey is her first-born child, Miss
Aubrey her last; four intervening children rest prematurely
in the grave&mdash;and the grief and suffering consequent
upon all these bereavements have sadly shaken her
constitution, and made her, both in actual health, and in
appearance, at least ten years older than she really is&mdash;for
she has, in point of fact, not long since entered her
sixtieth year. What a blessed life she leads at Yatton!
Her serene and cheerful temper makes every one happy
about her; and her charity is unbounded, but dispensed
with a just discrimination. One way or another, almost
a fourth of the village are direct pensioners upon her
bounty. You have only to mention the name of Madam
Aubrey, the lady of Yatton, to witness involuntary homage
paid to her virtues. Her word is law; and well indeed
it may be. While Mr. Aubrey, her husband, was,
to the last, somewhat stern in his temper and reserved in
his habits, bearing withal a spotless and lofty character,
<i>she</i> was always what she still is, meek, gentle, accessible,
charitable, and pious. On his death she withdrew from
the world, and has ever since resided at Yatton&mdash;never
having quitted it for a single day. There are in the vicinity
one or two stately families, with ancient name,
sounding title, and great possessions; but for ten miles
round Yatton, old Madam Aubrey, the squire's mother, is
the name that is enshrined in people's kindliest and most
grateful feelings, and receives their readiest homage. 'Tis
perhaps a very small matter to mention, but there is at
the hall an old white mare, Peggy, that for these twenty
years, in all weathers, hath been the bearer of Madam's
bounty. Thousands of times hath she carried Jacob Jones
(now a pensioned servant, whose hair is as white as Peggy's)
all over the estate, and also oft beyond it, with comfortable
matters for the sick and poor. Most commonly
there are a couple of stone bottles filled with cowslip,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
currant, ginger, or elderberry wine, slung before him over the
well-worn saddle&mdash;to the carrying of which Peggy has got
so accustomed, that she does not go comfortably without
them. She has so fallen into the habits of old Jones, who
is an inveterate gossip, (Madam having helped to make
him such by the numerous inquiries she makes of him
every morning as to every one in the village and on
the estate, and which inquiries he <i>must</i> have the means
of answering,) that, slowly as she jogs along, if ever she
meets or is overtaken by any one, she stops of her own accord,
as if to hear what they and her rider have to say to
one another. She is a great favorite with all, and gets a
mouthful of hay or grass at every place she stops at, either
from the children or the old people. When poor Peggy
comes to die, (and she is getting feeble, now,) she will be
missed by all the folk round Yatton! Madam Aubrey,
growing, I am sorry to say, less able to exert herself, does
not go about as much as she used, betaking herself, therefore,
oftener and oftener, to the old family coach; and
when she is going to drive about the neighborhood, you
may almost always see it stop at the vicarage for old Dr.
Tatham, who generally accompanies her. On these occasions
she always has in the carriage a black velvet bag
containing Testaments and Prayer-books, which are principally
distributed as rewards to those whom the parson
can recommend as deserving of them. For these five-and-twenty
years she has never missed giving a copy of each
to every child in the village and on the estate, on its being
confirmed; and the old lady looks round very keenly
every Sunday, from her pew, to see that these Bibles and
Prayer-books are reverently used. I could go on for an
hour and longer, telling you these and other such matters
of this exemplary lady; but we shall by and by have some
opportunities of seeing and knowing more of her personally.
Her features are delicate, and have been very handsome;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and in manner she is very calm, and quiet, and
dignified. She looks all that you would expect from what
I have told you. The briskness of youth, the sedate firmness
of middle-age, have years since given place, as you
will see with some pain, to the feebleness produced by
ill health and mental suffering&mdash;for she mourned grievously
after those whom she had lost! Oh! how she dotes
upon her surviving son and daughter! And are they not
worthy of such a mother?</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey is in his thirty-fourth year; and inherits
the mental qualities of both his parents&mdash;the demeanor
and person of his father. He has a reserve which is not
cynical, but only diffident; yet it gives him, at least at
first sight, and till you have become familiar with his
features, which are of a cast at once refined and aristocratic,
yet full of goodness&mdash;an air of hauteur, which is
very&mdash;very far from his real nature. He has in truth
the soft heart and benignant temper of his mother, joined
with the masculine firmness of character which belonged
to his father; which, however, is in danger of being
seriously impaired by <i>inaction</i>. Sensitive he is, perhaps
to a fault. There is a tone of melancholy in his composition,
which has probably increased upon him from his
severe studies, ever since his youth. He is a man of
superior intellect; a capital scholar; took the highest
honor at Oxford: and has since justified the expectations
which were then entertained of him. He has made several
really valuable contributions to historic literature&mdash;indeed,
I think he is even now engaged upon some researches
calculated to throw much light upon the obscure
origin of several of our political institutions. He has
entered upon <i>politics</i> with uncommon&mdash;perhaps with an
excessive&mdash;ardor. I think he is likely to make an eminent
figure in Parliament; for he is a man of very clear
head, very patient, of business-like habits, ready in debate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
and, moreover, has at once an impressive and engaging
delivery as a public speaker. He is generous and charitable
as his admirable mother, and careless, even to a fault,
of his pecuniary interests. He is a man of perfect simplicity
and purity of character. Above all, his virtues are
the virtues which have been sublimed by Christianity&mdash;as
it were, the cold embers of morality warmed into religion.
He stands happily equidistant from infidelity and
fanaticism. He has looked for light from above, and has
heard a voice saying, "<i>This</i> is the way, walk thou in it."
His piety is the real source of that happy consistent dignity,
and content, and firmness, which have earned him
the respect of all who know him, and will bear him
through whatever may befall him. He who standeth
upon this rock cannot be moved, perhaps not even
touched, by the surges of worldly reverses&mdash;of difficulty
and distress! In manner Mr. Aubrey is calm and gentlemanlike;
in person he is rather above the middle height,
and of slight make. From the way in which his clothes
hang about him, a certain sharpness at his shoulders
catching the eye of an observer&mdash;you would feel an anxiety
about his health, which would be increased by hearing
of the mortality in his family; and your thoughts are
perhaps pointed in the same direction, by a glance at his
long, thin, delicate, white hands. His countenance has a
serene manliness about it when in repose, and great acuteness
and vivacity when animated. His hair, not very
full, is black as jet, his forehead ample and marked;
and his eyes are the exponents of perfect sincerity and acuteness.</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey has been married about six years; 'twas
a case of love at first sight. Chance (so to speak) threw
him in the way of Agnes St. Clair, within a few weeks
after she had been bereaved of her only parent, Colonel
St. Clair, a man of old but impoverished family, who fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
in the Peninsular war. Had he lived only a month or
two longer, he would have succeeded to a considerable
estate; as it was, he left his only child comparatively
penniless; but Heaven had endowed her with personal
beauty, with a lovely disposition, and superior understanding.
It was not till after a long and anxious wooing,
backed by the cordial entreaties of Mrs. Aubrey, that Miss
St. Clair consented to become the wife of a man, who, to
this hour, loves her with all the passionate ardor with
which she had first inspired him. And richly she deserves
his love! She does, indeed, dote upon him; she
studies, or rather, perhaps, anticipates his every wish; in
short, had the whole sex been searched for one calculated
to make happy the morbidly fastidious Aubrey, the choice
must surely have fallen on Miss St. Clair; a woman whose
temper, whose tastes, and whose manners were at once in
delicate and harmonizing unison and contrast with his
own. She has hitherto brought him but two children&mdash;and
those very beautiful children, too&mdash;a boy between
four and five years old, and a girl about two years old.
If I were to hint my own impressions, I should say there
was a probability&mdash;&mdash; be that, however, as it may, 't&nbsp;is
an affair we have nothing to do with at present.</p>

<p>Of Catherine Aubrey you had a momentary moonlight
glimpse at a former period of this history;[<a href='#Note_14'>14</a>] and you
have seen her this evening under other, and perhaps not
less interesting circumstances. Now, where have you beheld
a more exquisite specimen of budding womanhood?
but I feel that I shall get extravagant if I begin to dwell
upon her charms. You have seen her&mdash;judge for yourself;
but you do not <i>know</i> her as I do; and I shall tell
you that her personal beauty is but a faint emblem of the
beauties of her mind and character. She is Aubrey's
youngest&mdash;now his only sister; and he cherishes her
with the tenderest and fondest affection. Neither he, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
his mother&mdash;with whom she spends her time alternately&mdash;can
bear to part with her for ever so short an interval.
She is the gay, romping playmate of the little Aubreys;
the demure secretary and treasurer of her mother. I say
<i>demure</i>, for there is a sly humor and archness in Kate's
composition, which flickers about even her gravest moods.
She is calculated equally for the seclusion of Yatton and
the splendid atmosphere of Almack's; but for the latter
she seems at present to have little inclination. Kate is
a girl of decided character, of strong sense, of high principle;
all of which are irradiated, not overborne, by her
sparkling vivacity of temperament. She has real talent;
and her mind has been trained, and her tastes directed,
with affectionate skill and vigilance by her gifted brother.
She has many accomplishments; but the only one I shall
choose here to name is&mdash;music. <i>She</i> was one to sing and
play before a man of the most fastidious taste and genius!
I defy any man to hear the rich tones of Miss Aubrey's
voice without feeling his heart moved. Music is with her
a matter not of <i>art</i> but of <i>feeling</i>&mdash;of passionate feeling;
but hark!&mdash;hush!&mdash;surely&mdash;yes, that is Miss Aubrey's
voice&mdash;yes, that is her clear and brilliant touch; the
ladies have ascended to the drawing-room, and we must
presently follow them. How time has passed! I had a
great deal more to tell you about the family, but we must
take some other opportunity.</p>

<p>Yes, it <i>is</i> Miss Aubrey, playing on the new and superb
piano given by her brother last week to Mrs. Aubrey.
Do you see with what a careless grace and ease she is
giving a very sweet but difficult composition of Haydn?
The lady who is standing by her to turn over her music,
is the celebrated Countess of Lydsdale. She is still
young and beautiful; but beside Miss Aubrey she presents
a somewhat painful contrast! 'T&nbsp;is all the difference
between an artificial and a natural flower. Poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Lady Lydsdale! you are not happy with all your fashion
and splendor; the glitter of your diamonds cannot
compensate for the loss of the sparkling spirits of a younger
day; they pale their ineffectual fires beside the fresh
and joyous spirit of Catherine Aubrey! You sigh&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, I'll sing you quite a new thing," said Miss
Aubrey, starting up, and turning over her portfolio till
she came to a sheet of paper, on which were some verses
in her own handwriting, and with which she sat down
again before the piano: "The words were written by my
brother, and I have found an old air that exactly suits
them!" Here her fingers, wandering lightly and softly
over the keys, gave forth a beautiful symphony in the
minor; after which, with a rich and soft voice, she sang
the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>To these words, trembling on the beautiful lips of Miss
Aubrey, was listening an unperceived auditor, with eyes
devouring her every feature, and ears absorbing every
tone of her thrilling voice. It was young Delamere, who
had, only a moment or two before Miss Aubrey had commenced
singing the above lines, alighted from his father's
carriage, which was then waiting at the door to carry off
Lord De la Zouch to the House of Lords. Arrested by
the rich voice of the singer, he stopped short before he
had entered the drawing-room in which she sat, and stepping
to a corner where he was hid from view, though
he could distinctly see Miss Aubrey, there he remained
as if rooted to the spot. He, too, had a soul for music;
and the exquisite manner in which Miss Aubrey gave
the last verse, called up before his excited fancy the
vivid image of a dove fluttering with agitated uncertainty
over the sea of human life; even like the dove over the
waters enveloping the earth in olden time. The mournful
minor into which she threw the last two lines, excited
a heart susceptible of the liveliest emotions to a degree
which it required some effort to control, and almost a
tear to relieve. When Miss Aubrey had quitted the
piano, Mrs. Aubrey followed, and gave a very delicate
sonata from Haydn. Then sat down Lady Lydsdale,
and dashed off, in an exceedingly brilliant style, a <i>scena</i>
from the new opera, which quickly reduced the excited
feelings of Delamere to a pitch admitting of his presenting
himself! While this lowering process was going on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Delamere took down a small volume from a tasteful little
cabinet of books immediately behind him. It was Spenser's
<i>Faery Queen</i>. He found many pencil-marks, evidently
made by a light female hand; and turning to the
fly-leaf, beheld the name of "<i>Catherine Aubrey</i>." His
heart fluttered; he turned towards the piano, and beheld
the graceful figure of Miss Aubrey standing beside Lady
Lydsdale, in an attitude of delighted earnestness&mdash;for
her ladyship was undoubtedly a very brilliant performer&mdash;totally
unconscious of the admiring eye which was
fixed upon her. After gazing at her for some moments,
he gently pressed the autograph to his lips; and solemnly
vowed within himself, in the most deliberate manner possible,
that if he could not marry Kate Aubrey, he would
never marry anybody; he would, moreover, quit England
forever; and deposit a broken heart in a foreign grave&mdash;and
so forth. Thus calmly resolved&mdash;or rather to such
a resolution did his thoughts tend&mdash;that sedate person,
the Honorable Geoffrey Lovel Delamere. He was a high-spirited,
frank-hearted fellow; and, like a good-natured
fool, whom bitter knowledge of the world has not cooled
down into contempt for a very considerable portion of it,
trusted and loved almost every one whom he saw. At
that moment there was only one person in the whole
world that he hated, viz. the miserable individual&mdash;if
any such there were&mdash;who might have happened to forestall
him in the affections of Miss Aubrey. The bare idea
made his breath come and go quickly, and his cheek
flush. Why, he felt that he had a sort of <i>right</i> to Miss
Aubrey's heart; for had they not been born, and had
they not lived almost all their lives, within a few miles
of each other? Had they not often played together?&mdash;were
not their family estates almost contiguous?&mdash;Delamere
advanced into the room, assuming as unconcerned
an air as he could; but he felt not a little tried when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Miss Aubrey, on seeing him, gayly and frankly extended
her hand to him, supposing him to have only the moment
before entered the house. Poor Delamere's hand slightly
quivered as he felt it clasping the soft lilied fingers of
her whom he had thus resolved to make his wife: what
would he not have given to have carried them to his
lips! Now, if I were to say that in the course of that
evening, Miss Aubrey did not form a kind&mdash;of a sort&mdash;of
a faint&mdash;notion of the possible state of matters with
young Delamere, I should not be treating the reader
with that eminent degree of candor for which I think
he, or she, is at present disposed to give me credit. But
Kate was deeply skilled in human nature, and promptly
settled the matter by one very just reflection, viz. that
Delamere was, in contemplation of law, a mere <i>infant</i>&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
he wanted yet several weeks of twenty-one! and,
therefore, that it was not likely that, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. And,
besides&mdash;pooh!&mdash;pooh!&mdash;'t is a mere <i>boy</i>, at College&mdash;how
ridiculous!&mdash;So she gave herself no trouble
about the affair; exhibited no symptoms of caution or
coyness, but conducted herself just as if he had not been present.</p>

<p>He was a handsome young fellow, too!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>During the evening, Mr. Delamere took an opportunity
of asking Miss Aubrey who wrote the verses to which
he pointed, as they lay on the piano. The handwriting,
she said, was hers, but the verses were composed by her
brother. He asked for the copy, with a slight trepidation.
She readily gave it to him&mdash;he receiving it with
(as he supposed) a mighty unconcerned air. He read it
over that night, before getting into bed, at least six times;
and it was the very first thing he looked at on getting out
of bed in the morning. Now Miss Aubrey certainly wrote
an elegant hand&mdash;but as for <i>character</i>, of course it had
none. He could scarcely have distinguished it from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
writing of any of his cousins or friends;&mdash;How should
he? All women are taught the same hard, angular, uniform
style&mdash;but good, bad, or indifferent, this was <i>Kate
Aubrey's</i> handwriting&mdash;and her pretty hand had rested
on the paper while writing&mdash;that was enough. He resolved
to turn the verses into every kind of Greek and
Latin metre he knew of&mdash;</p>

<p>In short, that here was a "course of true love" <i>opened</i>,
seems pretty evident: but whether it will "run smooth"
is another matter.</p>

<p>Their guests having at length departed, Mr. Aubrey,
his wife, and sister, soon afterwards rose to retire. He
went, very sleepy, straight to his dressing-room; they to
the nursery&mdash;(a constant and laudable custom with them)&mdash;to
see how the children were going on, as far as could
be learned from the drowsy attendants of the aforesaid
children. Little Aubrey would have reminded you of one
of the exquisite sketches of children's heads by Reynolds
or Lawrence, as he lay breathing imperceptibly, with his
rich flowing hair spread upon the pillow, in which his face
was partly hid, and his arms stretched out. Mrs. Aubrey
put her finger into one of his hands, which was half open,
and which closed as it were instinctively upon it, with
a gentle pressure. "Look&mdash;only look&mdash;Kate!" softly
whispered Mrs. Aubrey. Miss Aubrey leaned forward and
kissed his little cheek with an ardor which almost awoke
him. After a glance at a tiny head partly visible above
the clothes, in an adjoining bed, and looking like a rosebud
almost entirely hid among the leaves, they withdrew.</p>

<p>"The little loves!&mdash;how one's heart thrills with looking
at them!" said Miss Aubrey as they descended. "Kate!"
whispered Mrs. Aubrey, with an arch smile, as they stood
at their respective chamber doors, which adjoined, "Mr.
Delamere is improved&mdash;is not he?&mdash;Ah, Kate! Kate!&mdash;I understand!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>"Agnes, how can you"&mdash;hastily answered Miss Aubrey,
with cheeks suddenly crimsoned. "I never heard
such nonsense"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Night, night, Kate! think over it!" said Mrs. Aubrey,
and kissing her beautiful sister-in-law, the next moment the
blooming wife had entered her bedroom. Miss Aubrey
slipped into her dressing-room, where Harriet, her maid,
was sitting asleep before the fire. Her lovely mistress did
not for a few minutes awake her; but placing her candlestick
on the toilet table, stood in a musing attitude.</p>

<p>"It's so perfectly <i>ridiculous</i>" at length she said
aloud; and up started her maid. Within half an hour
Miss Aubrey was in bed, but by no means asleep!</p>

<p>The next morning, about eleven o'clock, Mr. Aubrey
was seated in the library, in momentary expectation of
his letters; and a few moments before the postman's <i>rat-tat</i>
was heard, Mrs. and Miss Aubrey made their appearance,
as was their wont, in expectation of anything which
might have upon the cover, in addition to the address&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Charles Aubrey, Esq.</span>, M. P.," &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.,</p></div>

<p>the words, "Mrs. Aubrey," or "Miss Aubrey," in the
corner. In addition to this, 'twas not an unpleasant
thing to skim over the contents of <i>his</i> letters! as one
by one he opened them, and laid them aside; for both
these fair creatures were daughters of Eve, and inherited
a <i>little</i> of her curiosity. Mr. Aubrey was always somewhat
nervous and fidgety on such occasions, and wished
them gone; but they only laughed at him, so he was fain
to put up with them. On this morning there were more
than Mr. Aubrey's usual number of letters; and in casting
her eye over them, Mrs. Aubrey suddenly took up one
that challenged attention; it bore a black seal, had a deep
black bordering, and bore the frank of Lord Alkmond, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
whose house in Shropshire they had for months been engaged
to spend the ensuing Christmas, and were intending
to set off on their visit the very next day. The ominous
missive was soon torn open; it was from Lord Alkmond
himself, who in a few hurried lines announced the sudden
death of his brother; so that there was an end of
their visit to the Priory.</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed Mr. Aubrey, calmly, rising after a
pause, and standing with his back to the fire, in a musing posture.</p>

<p>"Has he left any family, Charles?" inquired Mrs.
Aubrey, with a sigh, her eyes still fixed on the letter.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I really don't know&mdash;poor fellow! We lose a
vote for Fellington&mdash;we shall, to a certainty," he added,
with an air of chagrin visibly stealing over his features.</p>

<p>"How politics harden the heart, Charles! Just at <i>this</i>
moment to be"&mdash;&mdash; quoth Mrs. Aubrey.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> too bad, Agnes, I own&mdash;but you see," said Mr.
Aubrey, affectionately; suddenly, however, he broke off&mdash;"stay,
I don't know either, for there's the Grassingham
interest come into the field since the last"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Charles, I do really almost think," exclaimed Mrs.
Aubrey with sudden emotion, stepping to his side, and
throwing her arms round him affectionately, "that if <i>I</i>
were to die, I should be forgotten in a fortnight if the
House were sitting"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"How <i>can</i> you say such things, my love?" inquired
Mr. Aubrey, kissing her forehead.</p>

<p>"When Agnes was born, you know," she murmured
inarticulately. Her husband folded her tenderly in his
arms in silence. On the occasion she alluded to, he
had nearly lost her; and they both had reason to expect
that another similar season of peril was not <i>very</i> distant.</p>

<p>"Now, Charles, you <i>can't</i> escape," said Miss Aubrey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
presently, assuming a cheerful tone; "now for dear old Yatton!"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, Yatton! Positively you must!" added Mrs.
Aubrey, smiling through her tears.</p>

<p>"What! Go to Yatton?" said Mr. Aubrey, shaking
his head and smiling. "Nonsense! I&mdash;i&mdash;t ca&mdash;n't&mdash;be&mdash;done!&mdash;Why,
we must set off to-morrow!
They've had no warning!"</p>

<p>"What warning does mamma require, Charles?" inquired
his sister, eagerly. "Isn't the dear old place always
in apple-pie order?"</p>

<p>"How you love the 'dear old place,' Kate!" exclaimed
Mr. Aubrey, in such an affectionate tone as
brought his sister in an instant to his side, to urge on
her suit; and there stood the lord of Yatton embraced
by these two beautiful women, his own heart (<i>inter nos</i>)
seconding every word they uttered.</p>

<p>"How my mother would stare!" said he at length,
irresolutely, looking from one to the other, and smiling
at their eagerness.</p>

<p>"What a bustle everything will be in!" exclaimed
Kate. "I fancy I'm there already! The great blazing
fires&mdash;the holly and mistletoe. We must all go,
Charles&mdash;children and all!"</p>

<p>"Why, really, I hardly know"&mdash;&mdash; said Mr. Aubrey, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>I've</i> settled it all," quoth Kate, seeing that she
had gained her point, and resolved to press her advantage,
"and, what's more, we've no time to lose; this
is Tuesday,&mdash;Christmas-day is Saturday&mdash;we must of
course stop a night on the way; but hadn't we better
have Griffiths in, to arrange all?" Mr. Aubrey laughed&mdash;and&mdash;rang
the bell.</p>

<p>"Request Mr. Griffiths to come to me," said he to the
servant who answered the summons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Within a very few minutes that respectable functionary
had made his appearance and received his instructions.
The march to Shropshire was countermanded&mdash;and hey!
for Yatton!&mdash;for which they were to start the next day
about noon. Mr. Griffiths' first step was to pack off Sam,
Mr. Aubrey's groom, by the Tally-ho, the first coach to
York, starting at two o'clock that very day, with letters announcing
the immediate arrival of the family. These orders
were received by Sam, (who had been born and bred at
Yatton,) while he was bestowing, with vehement sibilation,
his customary civilities on a favorite mare of his
master's. Down dropped his currycomb; he jumped into
the air; snapped his fingers; then he threw his arms
round Jenny, and tickled her under the chin. "Dang
it," said he, as he threw her another feed of oats, "I
wish thee were going wi' me&mdash;dang'd if I don't!"
Then he hastily made himself "a <i>bit</i> tidy;" presented
himself very respectfully before Mr. Griffiths, to receive
the wherewithal to pay his fare; and having obtained it,
off he scampered to the Bull and Mouth, as if it had been
a neck-and-neck race between him and all London, which
should get down to Yorkshire first. A little after one
o'clock, his packet of letters was delivered to him; and
within another hour Sam was to be seen (quite comfortable,
with a draught of spiced ale given him by the
cook, to make his hasty dinner "sit well") on the top
of the Tally-ho, rattling rapidly along the great north road.</p>

<p>"Come, Kate," said Mrs. Aubrey, entering Miss Aubrey's
room, where she was giving directions to her maid,
"I've ordered the carriage to be at the door as soon as
it can be got ready; we must go off to Coutts'&mdash;see!"
She held in her hand two slips of paper, one of which
she gave Miss Aubrey. 'Twas a check for one hundred
pounds&mdash;her brother's usual Christmas-box&mdash;"and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
we've a quantity of little matters to buy this afternoon.
Come, Kate, quick! quick!"</p>

<p>Now, poor Kate had spent nearly all her money, which
circumstance, connected with another that I shall shortly
mention, had given her not a little concern. At her earnest
request, her brother had, about a year before, built
her a nice little school, capable of containing some eighteen
or twenty girls, on a slip of land between the vicarage
and the park wall of Yatton, and old Mrs. Aubrey
and her daughter found a resident schoolmistress, and,
in fact, supported the little establishment, which, at the
time I am speaking of, contained some seventeen or eighteen
of the villagers' younger children. Miss Aubrey took
a prodigious interest in this little school, scarce a day passing
without her visiting it when she was at Yatton; and
what Kate wanted, was the luxury of giving a Christmas
present to both mistress and scholars. That, however,
she would have had some difficulty in effecting but for
this her brother's timely present, which had quite set her
heart at ease. On their return, the carriage was crowded
with the things they had been purchasing&mdash;articles of
clothing for the feebler old villagers; work-boxes, samplers,
books, testaments, prayer-books, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c., for
the school; the sight of which, I can assure the reader,
made Kate far happier than if they had been the costliest
articles of dress and jewelry.</p>

<p>The next day was a very pleasant one for travelling&mdash;"frosty,
but kindly." About one o'clock there might have
been seen standing before the door the roomy yellow family
carriage, with four post-horses. All was in travelling
trim. In the rumble sat Mr. Aubrey's valet and Mrs.
Aubrey's maid&mdash;Miss Aubrey's, and one of the nursery-maids,
going down by the coach which had carried Sam&mdash;the
Tally-ho. The coach-box was piled up with that
sort of luggage which, by its lightness and bulk, denotes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
lady-travelling: inside were Mrs. and Miss Aubrey muffled
in furs, shawls, and pelisses; a nursery-maid, with little
Master and Miss Aubrey, equally well protected from
the cold; and the vacant seat awaited Mr. Aubrey, who
at length made his appearance, having been engaged till
the latest moment in giving and repeating specific instructions
concerning the forwarding of his letters and papers.
As soon as he had taken his place, and all had been snugly
disposed within, the steps were doubled up, the door was
closed, the windows were drawn up&mdash;crack! crack! went
the whips of the two postilions, and away rolled the carriage
over the dry hard pavement.</p>

<p>"Now that's what I calls doing it <i>uncommon</i> comfortable,"
said a pot-boy to one of the footmen at an adjoining
house, where he was delivering the porter for the
servants' dinner; "how <i>werry</i> nice and snug them two
looks in the rumble behind!"</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> goes to-morrow," carelessly replied the gentleman
whom he had addressed.</p>

<p>"It's a fine thing to be gentlefolk," said the boy, taking
up his pot-board.</p>

<p>"Pretty well&mdash;but one tires of it in time!" drawled
the footman, twitching up his shirt-collar.</p>

<p>On drawing up to the posting-house, which was within
about forty miles of Yatton, the Aubreys found a carriage
and four just ready to start, after changing horses; and
whose should this prove to be, but Lord De la Zouch's,
containing himself, his lady, and his son, Mr. Delamere!
His lordship and his son both alighted on accidentally
discovering who had overtaken them; and coming up to
Mr. Aubrey's carriage windows, exchanged surprised and
cordial greetings with its occupants&mdash;whom Lord De la
Zouch imagined to have been by this time on their way
to Shropshire. Mr. Delamere manifested a surprising
eagerness about the welfare of little Agnes Aubrey, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
happened to be lying fast asleep in Miss Aubrey's lap;
but the evening was fast advancing, and both the travelling
parties had yet before them a considerable portion
of their journey. After a hasty promise on the part of
each to dine with the other, before returning to town
for the season&mdash;a promise which <i>Mr. Delamere</i> at all
events resolved should not be lost sight of&mdash;they parted.
'Twas eight o'clock before Mr. Aubrey's eye, which had
been for some time on the look-out, caught sight of Yatton
woods; and when it did, his heart yearned towards
them. The moon shone brightly and cheerily, and it was
pleasant to listen to the quickening clattering tramp of the
horses upon the dry hard highway, as the travellers rapidly
neared a spot endeared to them by every early and
tender association. When they had got within half a
mile of the village, they overtook the worthy vicar, who
had mounted his nag, and had been out on the road to
meet the expected comers, for an hour before. Mr. Aubrey
roused Mrs. Aubrey from her nap, to point out Dr.
Tatham, who by that time was cantering along beside
the open window. 'Twas refreshing to see the cheerful
old man&mdash;who looked as ruddy and hearty as ever.</p>

<p>"God bless you all! All well?" he exclaimed, riding
close to the window.</p>

<p>"Yes; but how is my mother?" inquired Mr. Aubrey.</p>

<p>"High spirits&mdash;high spirits! Was with her this afternoon!
Have not seen her better for years! So surprised!
Ah! here's an old friend&mdash;Hector!"</p>

<p>"Bow-wow-wow-wow! Bow&mdash;Bow-wow!"</p>

<p>"Papa! papa!" exclaimed the voice of little Charles,
struggling to get on his father's lap to look out of the window,
"that is Hector! I know it is! He is come to see
<i>me</i>! I want to look at him."</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey lifted him up as he desired, and a huge
black-and-white Newfoundland dog almost leaped up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the window, at sight of him clapping his little hands, as
if in eager recognition, and then scampered and bounded
about in all directions, barking most boisterously, to the
infinite delight of little Aubrey. This messenger had
been sent on by Sam, the groom; who, having been on
the look-out for the travellers for some time, the moment
he had caught sight of the carriage, pelted down the village
through the park, at top speed, up to the Hall, there
to communicate the good news of their safe arrival. The
travellers thought that the village had never looked so
pretty and picturesque before. The sound of the carriage
dashing through it, called all the cottagers to their doors,
where they stood bowing and courtesying. It soon reached
the park-gates, which were thrown wide open in readiness
for its entrance. As they passed the church, they heard
its little bells ringing a merry peal to welcome their arrival.
Its faint chimes went to their very hearts.</p>

<p>"My darling Agnes, here we are again in the old place,"
said Mr. Aubrey, in a joyous tone, affectionately kissing
Mrs. Aubrey and his sister, as, after having wound their
way up the park at almost a gallop, they heard themselves
rattling over the stone pavement immediately under the
old turreted gateway. On approaching it, they saw lights
glancing about in the Hall windows; and before they had
drawn up, the great door was thrown open, and several
servants (one or two of them gray-headed) made their appearance,
eager to release the travellers from their long
confinement. A great wood fire was crackling and blazing
in the ample fireplace in the hall opposite the door,
casting a right pleasant and cheerful light over the various
antique objects ranged round the walls; but the object
on which Mr. Aubrey's eye instantly settled was the venerable
figure of his mother, standing beside the fireplace
with one or two female attendants. The moment that the
carriage door was opened, he stepped quickly out, (nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
tumbling, by the way, over Hector, who appeared to think
that the carriage door had been opened only to enable him
to jump into it, which he prepared to do.)</p>

<p>"God bless you, Madam!" said Mr. Aubrey, tenderly,
as he received his mother's fervent but silent greeting, and
imagined that the arms folded round him were somewhat
feebler than when he had last felt them embracing him!
With similar affection was the good old lady received by
her daughter and daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>"Where is my pony, grandmamma?" quoth little Aubrey,
running up to her, (he had been kept quiet, from
time to time, during the last eighty miles or so, by the
mention of the aforesaid pony, which had been sent to the
Hall as a present to him some weeks before.) "Where is
it? I want to see my little pony directly! Mamma says
you have got a little pony for me with a long tail; I <i>must</i>
see it before I go to bed; I must, indeed&mdash;is it in the
stable?"</p>

<p>"You shall see it in the morning, my darling&mdash;the very
first thing," said Mrs. Aubrey, fervently kissing her beautiful
little grandson, while tears of joy and pride ran down
her cheek. She then pressed her lips on the delicate but
flushed cheek of little Agnes, who was fast asleep; and as
soon as they had been conducted towards their nursery,
Mrs. Aubrey, followed by her children, led the way to the
dining-room&mdash;the dear delightful old dining-room, in
which all of them had passed so many happy hours of
their lives. It was large and lofty; and two antique
branch silver candlesticks, standing on sconces upon each
side of a strange old straggling carved mantelpiece of inlaid
oak, aided by the blaze given out by two immense
logs of wood burning beneath, thoroughly illuminated it.
The walls were oak-panelled, containing many pictures,
several of them of great value; and the floor also was of
polished oak, over the centre of which, however, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
spread a thick richly-colored Turkey carpet. Opposite the
door was a large mullioned bay-window, then, however,
concealed behind an ample flowing crimson curtain. On
the farther side of the fireplace stood a high-backed and
roomy armchair, almost covered With Kate's embroidery,
and in which Mrs. Aubrey had evidently, as usual, been
sitting till the moment of their arrival&mdash;for on a small
ebony table beside it lay her spectacles, and an open volume.
Nearly fronting the fireplace was a recess, in which
stood an exquisitely carved black ebony cabinet, inlaid
with white and red ivory. This, Miss Aubrey claimed as
her own, and had appropriated it to her own purposes ever
since she was seven years old. "You dear old thing!"
said she, throwing open the folding-doors&mdash;"Everything
just as I left it! Really, dear mamma, I could skip
about the room for joy! I wish Charles would never
leave Yatton again!"</p>

<p>"It's rather lonely, my love, when <i>none</i> of you are with
me," said Mrs. Aubrey. "I feel getting older"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dearest mamma," interrupted Miss Aubrey, quickly,
and embracing her mother, "<i>I</i> won't leave you again!
I'm quite tired of town&mdash;I am indeed!"</p>

<p>Though fires were lit in their several dressing-rooms, of
which they were more than once reminded by their respective
attendants, they all remained seated before the
fire in carriage costume, (except that Kate had thrown
aside her bonnet, her half-uncurled tresses hanging in negligent
profusion over her thickly-furred pelisse,) eagerly
conversing about the little incidents of their journey, and
the events which had transpired at Yatton since they had
quitted it. At length, however, they retired to perform
the refreshing duties of the dressing-room, before sitting
down to supper. Of that comfortable meal, within twenty
minutes' time or so, they partook with a hearty relish.
What mortal, however delicate, could resist the fare set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
before them&mdash;the plump capon, the delicious grilled ham,
the poached eggs, the floury potatoes, home-baked bread,
white and brown&mdash;custards, mince-pies, home-brewed ale,
as soft as milk, as clear as amber&mdash;mulled claret&mdash;and
so forth? The travellers had evidently never relished anything
more, to the infinite delight of old Mrs. Aubrey;
who observing, soon afterwards, irrepressible symptoms
of fatigue and drowsiness, ordered them all off to bed&mdash;Kate
sleeping in the same chamber in which she was sitting
when the reader was permitted to catch a moonlight
glimpse of her.</p>

<p>They did not make their appearance the next morning
till after nine o'clock, Mrs. Aubrey having read prayers
before the assembled servants, as usual, nearly an hour
before&mdash;a duty her son always performed when at the
Hall; but on this occasion he had overslept himself. He
found his mother in the breakfast-room, where she was
soon joined by her daughter and daughter-in-law, all of
them being in high health and spirits. Just as they were
finishing breakfast, little Aubrey burst into the room in
a perfect ecstasy&mdash;for old Jones had taken him round to
the stables, and shown him the little pony which had
been recently presented to him. He had heard it neigh&mdash;had
seen its long tail&mdash;had patted its neck&mdash;had seen
it eat&mdash;and now his vehement prayer was, that his papa,
and mamma, and Kate would immediately go and see it,
and take his little sister also.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, they separated. Old Mrs. Aubrey went
to her own room to be attended by her housekeeper; the
other two ladies retired to their rooms&mdash;Kate principally
engaged in arranging her presents for her little scholars:
and Mr. Aubrey repaired to his library&mdash;as delightful an
old snuggery as the most studious recluse could desire&mdash;where
he was presently attended by his bailiff. He found
that everything was going on as he could have wished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
With one or two exceptions, his rents were paid most
punctually; the farms and lands kept in capital condition.
To be sure an incorrigible old poacher had been
giving a little trouble, as usual, and stood committed for
trial at the ensuing Spring Assizes; and a few trivial
trespasses had been committed in search of firewood, and
other small matters; which, after having been detailed
with great minuteness by his zealous and vigilant bailiff,
were despatched by Mr. Aubrey with a "pooh, pooh!"&mdash;Then
there was Gregory, who held the smallest farm on the
estate, at its southern extremity&mdash;he was three quarters'
rent in arrear&mdash;but he had a sick wife and seven children&mdash;so
he was at once forgiven all that was due, and also
what would become due, on the ensuing quarter-day.&mdash;"In
fact," said Mr. Aubrey, "don't ask him for any more
rent. I'm sure the poor fellow will pay when he's able."</p>

<p>Some rents were to be raised; others lowered; and
some half dozen of the poorer cottages were to be forthwith
put into good repair, at Mr. Aubrey's expense. The
two oxen had been sent, on the preceding afternoon, from
the home farm to the butcher's, to be distributed on
Christmas eve among the poorer villagers, according to
orders brought down from town by Sam the day before.
Thus was Mr. Aubrey engaged for an hour or two, till
luncheon time, when good Dr. Tatham made his welcome
appearance, having been engaged most of the morning in
touching up an old Christmas sermon.</p>

<p>He had been vicar of Yatton for about thirty years,
having been presented to it by the late Mr. Aubrey, with
whom he had been intimate at college. He was a delightful
specimen of a country parson. Cheerful, unaffected,
and good-natured, there was a dash of quaintness or
roughness about his manners, that reminded you of the
crust in very fine old port. He had been a widower, and
childless, for fifteen years. His parish had been ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
since his family, whom he still watched over with an
affectionate vigilance. He was respected and beloved by
all. Almost every man, woman, and child that had died
in Yatton, during nearly thirty years, had departed with
the sound of his kind and solemn voice in their ears. He
claimed a sort of personal acquaintance with almost all
the gravestones in his little churchyard; he knew the
names of all who slept beneath them; and when he
looked at those gravestones, his conscience bore him witness,
that he had done his duty by the dust of whom
they spoke. He was at the bedside of a sick person
almost as soon, and as often, as the doctor&mdash;no matter
what sort of weather, or at what hour of the day or night.
Methinks I see him now, bustling about the village, with
healthy ruddy cheek, a clear, cheerful eye, hair white as
snow! with a small stout figure, clothed in a suit of somewhat
rusty black, (knee-breeches and gaiters all round the
year,) and with a small shovel-hat. No one lives in the
vicarage with him but an elderly woman, his housekeeper,
and her husband, whose chief business is to look after the
doctor's old mare and the little garden; in which I have
often seen him and his master, with his coat off, digging
for an hour or two together. He rises at five in the
winter, and four in the summer, being occupied till breakfast
with his studies; for he was an excellent scholar, and
has not forgotten, in the zealous discharge of his sacred
duties, the pursuits of literature and philosophy, in which
he had gained no inconsiderable distinction in his youth.
He derives a very moderate income from his living; but
it is even more than sufficient for his necessities. Ever
since Mr. Aubrey's devotion to politics has carried him
away from Yatton for a considerable portion of each year,
Dr. Tatham has been the right hand counsellor of old
Mrs. Aubrey, in all her pious and charitable plans and
purposes. Every New-year's day, there come from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Hall to the vicarage six dozen of fine old port wine&mdash;a
present from Mrs. Aubrey; but the little doctor (though
he never tells her so) scarce drinks six bottles of them in
a year. Two dozen of them go, within a few days' time,
to a poor brother parson in an adjoining parish, who, with
his wife and three children&mdash;all in feeble health&mdash;can
hardly keep body and soul together, and who, but for this
generous brother, would not probably taste wine throughout
the year, except on certain occasions when the very
humblest may moisten their poor lips with wine&mdash;I mean
the <span class="smcap">Sacrament</span>&mdash;the sublime and solemn festival given
by One who doth not forget the poor and destitute, however
in their misery they may sometimes think to the
contrary!&mdash;The remainder of his little present Dr.
Tatham distributes in small quantities among such of
his parishioners as may require it, and may not happen
to have come under the immediate notice of Mrs. Aubrey.
Dr. Tatham has known Mr. Aubrey ever since he was
about five years old. 'Twas the doctor that first taught
him Greek and Latin; and, up to his going to college,
gave him the frequent advantage of his learned experience.&mdash;But
surely I have gone into a very long digression,
and must return.</p>

<p>While Miss Aubrey, accompanied by her sister-in-law,
and followed by a servant carrying a great bag, filled with
articles brought from London the day before, went to the
school which I have before mentioned, in order to distribute
her prizes and presents, Mr. Aubrey and Dr. Tatham
set off on a walk through the village.</p>

<p>"I must really do something for that old steeple of
yours, Doctor," said Mr. Aubrey, looking up, and shading
his eyes with his hands, as, arm in arm, they approached
the church; "it looks crumbling away in many parts!"</p>

<p>"If you'd only send a couple of masons to repair the
<i>porch</i>, and make it weather-tight, it would satisfy me for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
some years to come," said the doctor, with exceeding earnestness.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;we'll look at it," replied Aubrey; and, turning
aside, they entered the little churchyard.</p>

<p>"How I love this old yew-tree!" he exclaimed, as they
passed under it; "it casts a kind of tender gloom around
that always makes me pensive, not to say melancholy!"
A sigh escaped him, as his eye glanced at the family vault,
which was almost in the centre of the shade, where lay
his father, three brothers, and a sister, and where, in the
course of nature, a few short years would see the precious
remains of his mother deposited. But the doctor who
had hastened forward alone for a moment, finding the
church door open, called out to Mr. Aubrey, who soon
stood within the porch. It certainly required a little
repairing, which Mr. Aubrey said should be looked to
immediately. "See&mdash;we're all preparing for to-morrow,"
said Dr. Tatham, leading the way into the little church,
where the grizzle-headed clerk was busy decorating the
old-fashioned pulpit, reading-desk, and altar-piece, with
the cheerful emblems of the season.</p>

<p>"I never see these," said the doctor, taking up one of
the sprigs of mistletoe lying on a form beside them, "but
I think of your own Christmas verses, Mr. Aubrey, when
you were younger and fresher than you now are&mdash;don't
you recollect them?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;pooh!" quoth Aubrey, somewhat hastily.</p>

<p>"But I remember them," rejoined the doctor; and he
began with great emphasis and solemnity&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hail! silvery, modest mistletoe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wreath'd round winter's brow of snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clinging so chastely, tenderly:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hail holly, darkly, richly green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose crimson berries blush between<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy prickly foliage, modestly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye winter-flowers, bloom sweet and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though Nature's garden else be bare&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye vernal glistening emblems, meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To twine a Christmas coronet!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"That will do, Doctor," interrupted Aubrey, smiling&mdash;"what
a memory you have for trifles!"</p>

<p>"Peggy! Peggy!&mdash;you're sadly overdoing it," said
the doctor, hastily, calling out to the sexton's wife, who
was busy at work in the squire's pew&mdash;a large square
pew in the nave, near the pulpit. "Why, do you want
to hide the squire's family from the congregation? You're
putting quite a holly hedge all round!"</p>

<p>"Please you, sir," quoth Peggy, "I've got so much
I don't know where to put it&mdash;so, in course, I put it here!"</p>

<p>"Then," said the doctor, with a smile, looking round
the church, "let Jonas get up and stick some of it into
those old hatchments; and," looking up at the clerk, busy
at work in the pulpit, "don't you put quite so much up
there into my candlesticks!"</p>

<p>With this the parson and the squire took their departure.
As they passed slowly up the village, which already
wore a sort of holiday aspect, they met on all hands with
a cordial, respectful, and affectionate greeting. The quiet
little public-house turned out some four or five stout
steady fellows&mdash;all tenants of Mr. Aubrey's&mdash;with
their pipes in their hands, and who took off their hats,
and bowed very low. Mr. Aubrey went up and entered
into conversation with them for some minutes. Their
families and farms, he found, were well and thriving.
There was quite a little crowd of women about the shop
of Nick Steele, the butcher, who, with an extra hand to
help him, was giving out the second ox which had been
sent from the Hall, to the persons whose names had been
given in to him from Mrs. Aubrey. Farther on, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
were cleaning their little windows, others sweeping their
floors, and sprinkling sand over them; most were displaying
holly and mistletoe in their windows, and over
their mantelpieces. Everywhere, in short, was to be seen
that air of quiet preparation for the solemnly-cheerful
morrow, which fills a thoughtful English observer with
feelings of pensive but exquisite satisfaction.</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey returned home towards dusk, cheered and
enlivened by his walk. His sudden plunge into the simplicity
and comparative solitude of country life&mdash;and
that country Yatton&mdash;had quite refreshed his feelings,
and given a tone to his spirits. Of course Dr. Tatham
was to dine at the Hall on the morrow; if he did not,
indeed, it would have been for the first time during the
last five-and-twenty years!</p>

<p>Christmas eve passed pleasantly and quietly enough at
the Hall. After dinner the merry little ones were introduced,
and their prattle and romps occupied an hour
right joyously. As soon as, smothered with kisses, they
had been dismissed to bed, old Mrs. Aubrey composed
herself, in her great chair, to her usual after-dinner's nap;
while her son, his wife, and sister, sitting fronting the
fire&mdash;a decanter or two, and a few wine-glasses and
dessert, remaining on the table behind them&mdash;sat conversing
in a subdued tone, now listening to the wind
roaring in the chimney&mdash;a sound which not a little
enhanced their sense of comfort&mdash;then criticising the
disposition of the evergreens with which the room was
plenteously decorated, and laying out their movements
during the ensuing fortnight. Mrs. Aubrey and Kate
were, with affectionate earnestness, contrasting to Aubrey
the peaceful pleasures of a country life with the restless
excitement and endless anxieties of a London political
life, to which they saw him more and more addicting
himself; he all the while playfully parrying their attacks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
but secretly acknowledging the truth and force of what
they said, when&mdash;hark!&mdash;a novel sound from without,
which roused the old lady from her nap. What do you
think, dear reader, it was? The voices of very little
girls singing what seemed to be a Christmas hymn: yes,
they caught the words&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hark! the herald angels sing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glory to the new-born king;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peace on earth and mercy mild"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Why, surely&mdash;it must be your little school-girls,"
said old Mrs. Aubrey, looking at her daughter, and listening.</p>

<p>"I do believe it is!" quoth Kate, her eyes suddenly
filling with tears, as she sat eagerly inclining her ear
towards the window.</p>

<p>"They must be standing on the grass-plot just before
the window," said Mr. Aubrey: the tiny voices were
thrilling his very heart within him. His sensitive nature
might have been compared to a delicate Æolian
harp which gave forth, with the slightest breath of accident
or circumstance,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The still, sad music of humanity."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In a few moments he was almost in tears&mdash;the sounds
were so unlike the fierce and turbulent cries of political
warfare to which his ears had been latterly accustomed!
The more the poor children sang, the more was he affected.
Kate's tears fell fast, for she had been in an excited
mood before this little incident occurred. "Do you
hear, mamma," said she, "the voice of the poor little thing
that was last taken into the school? The little darling!"
Kate tried to smile away her emotion; but 'twas in vain.
Mr. Aubrey gently drew aside the curtain, and pulled up
the central blind&mdash;and there, headed by their matron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
stood the little singers exposed to view, some eighteen in
number, ranged in a row on the grass, all in snug gray
woollen hoods effectually protecting them from the cold.
The oldest seemed not more than ten or twelve years
old, while the younger ones could not be more than
five or six. They seemed all singing from their very
hearts. Aubrey stood looking at them with very deep
interest.</p>

<p>As soon as they had finished their hymn, they were
conducted into the housekeeper's room, according to orders
sent for that purpose, from Mrs. Aubrey, and each
of them received a little present of money, besides a full
glass of Mrs. Jackson's choicest raisin wine, and a currant
bun; Kate slipping half-a-guinea into the hand of their
mistress, to whose wish to afford gratification to the inmates
of the Hall was entirely owing the little incident
which had so pleased and surprised them. "A happy
Christmas to you, dear papa and mamma!" said little
Aubrey, about eight o'clock the next morning, pushing
aside the curtains, and trying to clamber up on the high
bed where Mr. and Mrs. Aubrey were still asleep&mdash;soon,
however, they were awakened by the dear welcome voice!
The morning promised a beautiful day. The air, though
cold, was clear; and the branches of the trees visible from
their windows, were all covered with hoar-frost, which
seemed to line them as if with silver fringe. The little
bells of Yatton church were ringing a merry peal; but
how different in tone and strength from the clangor of
the London church-bells!&mdash;Christmas was indeed at last
arrived&mdash;and cheerful were the greetings of those who
soon after met at the bountiful breakfast table. Old Mrs.
Aubrey was going to church with them&mdash;in fact, not even
a domestic who could be possibly spared, was to be left
at home. By the time that the carriage, with the fat
and lazy-looking gray horses, was at the Hall door, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
sun had burst out in beauty from an almost cloudless
sky. The three ladies rode alone; Aubrey preferring to
walk, accompanied by his little son, as the ground was
dry and hard, and the distance very short. A troop of
some twelve or fourteen servants, male and female, presently
followed; and then came Mr. Aubrey, leading along
the heir of Yatton&mdash;a boy of whom he might well be
proud, as the future possessor of his name, his fortune,
and his honors. When he had reached the church, the
carriage was returning home. Almost the whole congregation
stood collected before the church door, to see
the squire's family enter; and reverent were the courtesies
and bows with which old Mrs. Aubrey and her lovely companions
were received. Very soon after they had taken
their places, Mr. Aubrey and his son made their appearance;
objects they were of the deepest interest, as they
passed along to their pew. A few minutes afterwards little
Dr. Tatham entered the church in his surplice, (which
he almost always put on at home,) with a face, composed
and serious to be sure, but yet overspread with an expression
even more bland and benignant than usual. He
knew there was not a soul among the little crowd around
him that did not really love him, and that did not know
how heartily he returned their love. All eyes were of
course on the squire's pew. Mrs. Aubrey was looking
well&mdash;her daughter and daughter-in-law were thought
by all to be by far the most beautiful women in the
world&mdash;what must people think of them in London?
Mr. Aubrey looked, they thought, pleased and happy,
but rather paler, and even a little thinner; and as for
the "<i>little</i> squire," with his bright eyes, his rosy cheeks,
his arch smile, his curling auburn hair&mdash;and so like his
father and mother&mdash;he was the pride of Yatton!</p>

<p>Dr. Tatham read prayers, as he always did; with great
distinctness and deliberation, so that everybody in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
church, young and old, could catch every syllable; and
he preached, considerately enough, a very short sermon&mdash;pithy,
homely, and affectionate. He reminded them
that he was then preaching his thirty-first Christmas-day
sermon from that pulpit! The service and the sacrament
over, none of the congregation moved from their places
till the occupants of the squire's pew had quitted it; but
as soon as they had got outside of the door, the good people
poured out after them, and almost lined the way from
the church door to the gate at which the carriage stood,
receiving and answering a hundred kind inquiries concerning
themselves, their families, and their circumstances.</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey stayed behind, desirous of taking another
little ramble with Dr. Tatham through the village, for
the day was indeed bright and beautiful, and the occasion
inspiriting. There was not a villager within four
or five miles of the Hall who did not sit down that day
to a comfortable little relishing dinner, at least one-third
of them being indebted for it directly to the bounty of
the Aubreys. As soon as Dr. Tatham had taken off his
gown, he accompanied Mr. Aubrey in cheerful mood, in
the briskest spirits. 'T&nbsp;was delightful to see the smoke
come curling out of every chimney, while few folk were
visible out of doors; whence you reasonably concluded
that they were all housed, and preparing for, or partaking
of, their roast-beef and plum-pudding! Now and
then the bustling wife would show her heated red face
at the door, and hastily courtesy as they passed, then
returning to dish up her little dinner.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha; Mr. Aubrey!&mdash;isn't such a day as this worth
a whole year in town?" exclaimed Dr. Tatham.</p>

<p>"Both have their peculiar advantages, Doctor; the
pleasure of the contrast would be lost if"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Contrast! Believe me, in the language of the poet Virgil"&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! how goes on old blind Bess, Doctor?" interrupted
Aubrey, as they approached the smallest cottage
in the village&mdash;in fact the very last.</p>

<p>"She's just the same as she has been these last twenty
years. Shall we look in on the old creature?"</p>

<p>"With all my heart. I hope, poor soul! that <i>she</i> has
not been overlooked on this festive occasion."</p>

<p>"Trust Mrs. Aubrey for that! I'll answer for it, we
shall find old Bess as happy, in her way, as she can be."</p>

<p>This was a stone blind old woman, who had been bedridden
for the last twenty years. She had certainly passed
her hundredth year&mdash;some said two or three years before&mdash;and
had lived in her present little cottage for nearly
half a century, having grown out of the recollection of almost
all the inhabitants of the village. She had long been
a pensioner of Mrs. Aubrey's, by whom alone, indeed, she
was supported. Her great age, her singular appearance,
and a certain rambling way of talking that she had, had
long earned her the reputation, in the village, of being able
to say strange things; and one or two of the old gossips
knew of things coming to pass according to what&mdash;poor
old soul&mdash;she had predicted!</p>

<p>Dr. Tatham gently pushed open the door. The cottage
consisted, in fact, of but one room, and that a very small
one, and lit by only one little window. The floor was clean,
and evidently just fresh sanded. On a wooden stool, opposite
a fireplace, on which a small saucepan was placed,
sat a girl about twelve years old, (a daughter of the woman
who lived nearest,) crumbling some bread into a basin, with
some broth in it. On a narrow bed against the wall, opposite
the window, was to be seen the somewhat remarkable
figure of the solitary old tenant of the cottage. She
was sitting up, resting against the pillow, which was
placed on end against the wall. She was evidently a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
tall woman; and her long, brown, wrinkled, shrivelled face,
with prominent cheekbones and bushy white eyebrows, betokened
the possession, in earlier days, of a most masculine
expression of features. Her hair, white as snow, was
gathered back from her forehead, under a spreading plain
white cap; and her sightless eyes, wide open, stared forward
with a startling and somewhat sinister expression.
She was wrapped round in a clean white bedgown; and
her long thin arms lay straight before her on the outside
of the bedclothes. Her lips were moving, as if she were
talking to herself.</p>

<p>"She's a strange-looking object, indeed!" exclaimed Mr.
Aubrey, as he and Dr. Tatham stood watching her for a
few moments in silence.</p>

<p>"Dame! dame!" said the doctor, loudly, approaching
her bedside, "how are you to-day? It's Christmas-day&mdash;I
wish you a merry Christmas."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay&mdash;merry, merry!" echoed the old woman, with
a half-groan. "More the merrier! I've seen a hundred
and nine of them!"</p>

<p>"You seem comfortable enough, dame," said Mr. Aubrey,
kindly. "I hope you <i>are</i>?"</p>

<p>"They won't give me my broth&mdash;my broth," said she, peevishly.</p>

<p>"It's coming, granny," called out the shrill voice of the
girl sitting before the fire, quickening her motions.</p>

<p>"Here's the squire come to see you, dame, and he wishes
you a happy Christmas," said Dr. Tatham, loudly.</p>

<p>"What! the squire? Alive yet? Ah, well-a-day! well-a-day!"
said she, in a feeble, mournful tone, slowly rubbing
together her long, skinny, wrinkled hands, on the
backs of which the veins stood out like knotted whipcord.
She repeated the last words several times, in a truly doleful
tone, gently shaking her head.</p>

<p>"Granny's been very sad, sir, to-day, and cried two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
three times," said the little girl, stirring about the hot broth.</p>

<p>"Poor squire! doth he not look sad?" inquired the old woman.</p>

<p>"Why should I, dame? What have I to fear?" said
Mr. Aubrey, somewhat quickly.</p>

<p>"Merry in the Hall! all, merry! merry! But no one
has heard it except old blind Bess. Where's the squire?"
she added, suddenly turning full towards the spot where
they were standing&mdash;and her face seemed whitened with
emotion. Her staring eyes were settled on Mr. Aubrey's
face, as if she saw him distinctly, and were reading his
very soul.</p>

<p>"Here I am, dame," said he, with a great deal of curiosity,
to say the least of it.</p>

<p>"Give me your hand, Squire," said she, stretching out
her left arm, and working about her talon-like fingers, as
if in eagerness to grasp Mr. Aubrey's hand, which he gave her.</p>

<p>"Never fear! never, never! Happy in the Hall! I
see all! How long"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, dame, this is truly a very pleasant greeting of
yours," interposed Dr. Tatham, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Short and bitter! long and sweet! Put your trust
in God, Squire."</p>

<p>"I hope I do, granny," replied Mr. Aubrey, seriously.</p>

<p>"I see! I hear!&mdash;my broth! my broth!&mdash;where is it?"</p>

<p>"Here it is, granny," said the girl&mdash;"It's all ready!"</p>

<p>"Good-day, dame," said Mr. Aubrey, gently disengaging
his hand from hers; and before they had left the cottage,
she began to swallow very greedily the broth with
which the little girl fed her.</p>

<p>"This is the sort of way in which this old superannuated
creature has frightened one or two of"&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is it indeed?" inquired Mr. Aubrey, with a sort of
mechanical smile. Dr. Tatham saw that he was in a
somewhat serious humor.</p>

<p>"She's alarmed <i>you</i>, I protest!&mdash;I protest she has!"
exclaimed the doctor, with a slight laugh, as they walked
along. Now, he knew the disposition and character of
Aubrey intimately; and was well aware of a certain tendency
which he had to superstition.</p>

<p>"My dear doctor, I assure you that you are mistaken&mdash;I
am indeed not <i>alarmed</i>&mdash;but at the same time
I will tell you something not a little singular. Would
you believe that a month or two ago, when in town, I
dreamed that I heard some one uttering something very
much like the words which we have just heard from this
old woman?"</p>

<p>"Ah! ha, ha!" laughed the doctor; and, after a second
or two's pause, Aubrey, as if ashamed of what he had
said, echoed the laugh, and their conversation passed on to
political topics, which kept them engaged for the remainder
of their walk, Mr. Aubrey quitting his companion at
the door of the vicarage, to be rejoined by him at five
o'clock, the dinner hour at the Hall. As Mr. Aubrey
walked along the park, the shades of evening casting a
deepening gloom around him, his thoughts involuntarily
recurred to the cottage of old blind Bess, and he felt vague
apprehensions flitting with darkening shade across his
mind. Though he was hardly weak enough to attach any
definite meaning or importance to the gibberish he had
heard, it still had left an unpleasant <i>impression</i>, and he
was vexed at feeling a wish that the incident&mdash;trifling as
he was willing to believe it&mdash;should not be mentioned
by Dr. Tatham at the Hall; and still more was he excited
when he recollected that he had <i>purposely abstained</i>
from requesting the good doctor not to do so. All this
undoubtedly implied that the matter had occupied Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Aubrey's thoughts to a greater extent than he secretly
relished. On reaching, however, the Hall door, this brief
pressure on his feelings quickly ceased; for on entering,
he saw Mrs. Aubrey, his sister, and his two children, at
high romps together in the hall, and he heartily joined
in them.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>
<hr class='chapter' />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>By five o'clock the little party were seated at the cheerful
dinner-table, glistening with the old family plate and
that kind of fare, at once substantial and luxurious, which
befitted the occasion. Old Mrs. Aubrey, in her simple
white turban and black velvet dress, presided with a
kind of dignified cheerfulness which was delightful to
see. Kate had contrived to make herself look more
lovely even than usual, wearing a dress of dark blue
satin, tastefully trimmed with blonde, and which exquisitely
comported with her beautiful complexion. Oh
that Delamere had been sitting opposite to, or beside her!
The more matured proportions of her blooming sister-in-law
appeared to infinite advantage in a rich green velvet
dress, while a superb diamond glistened with subdued lustre
in her beautiful bosom. She wore no ornaments in
her dark hair, which was, as indeed might be said of Kate,
"when unadorned, adorned the most." The gray-headed
old butler, (as brisk as his choicest champagne,) and the
two steady-looking old family servants, going about their
business with quiet celerity&mdash;the delicious air of antique
elegance around them&mdash;the sense of profound seclusion&mdash;of
remoteness from the exciting hubbub of the world&mdash;in
every respect this was a Christmas dinner after one's
own heart! Oh the merry and dear old Yatton! And
as if there were not loveliness enough already in the
room, behold the door suddenly pushed open, as soon as
the dessert is arrayed on the table, and run up to his gay
and laughing mother, her little son, his ample snowy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
collar resting gracefully on his crimson velvet dress. 'Tis
her hope and pride&mdash;her first-born&mdash;the little squire;
but where is his sister?&mdash;where is Agnes? 'Tis even as
Charles says&mdash;she fell asleep in the very act of being
dressed, and they were obliged to put her to bed; so
Charles is alone in his glory. You may well fold your
delicate white arm around him, mamma!&mdash;</p>

<p>His little gold cup is nearly filled to join in the first
toast: are you all&mdash;dear little circle!&mdash;are you all
ready? The worthy doctor has poured old Mrs. Aubrey's,
and young Mrs. Aubrey's, and Kate's glass full up to the
brim:&mdash;"<i>Our next Christmas!</i>" quoth he, cheerily elevating
his glass.</p>

<p>Yes, your next Christmas! The vigilant eye of Dr.
Tatham alone perceived a faint change of color in Mr.
Aubrey's cheek as the words were uttered; and his eye
wandered for an instant, as if tracing across the room the
image of old blind Bess; but 'twas gone in a moment;
Aubrey was soon in much higher spirits than usual. Well
he might be. How could man be placed in happier circumstances
than he was? As soon as the three ladies
had withdrawn, together with little Aubrey, the doctor
and Mr. Aubrey drew their chairs before the fire, and enjoyed
a long hour's pleasant conversation, on matters domestic
and political. As to the latter, the doctor and the
squire were stout Tories; and a speech which Aubrey had
lately delivered in the House, on the Catholic claims, had
raised him to a pitch of eminence in the doctor's estimation,
where Aubrey had very few men in the country to keep
him company. The doctor here got on very fast indeed;
and was just assuring the squire that he saw dark days
in store for Old England from the machinations of the
Papists; and that, for his part, he should rejoice to "seal
his testimony with his blood," and would go to the stake
not only without flinching, but rejoicing&mdash;(all which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
verily believe <i>he</i> verily believed he would have done) and
coveting the crown of martyrdom&mdash;when Aubrey caught
the sound of his sister playing on the organ, a noble instrument,
which a year or two before, at her urgent request,
he had purchased and placed in the drawing-room, whither
he and the doctor at once repaired. 'Twas a spacious
and lofty room, well calculated for the splendid instrument
which occupied the large recess fronting the door.
Miss Aubrey was playing Handel, and with an exquisite
perception of his matchless power and beauty. Hark!
did you ever hear the grand yet simple recitative she is
now commencing?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>In the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men
from the East to Jerusalem,</i></p>

<p>"<i>Saying&mdash;Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we
have seen his star in the East, and are come to worship him.</i>"</p></div>

<p>The doctor officiated as chaplain that evening. The
room was almost filled with servants, many of whose looks
very plainly showed the merry doings which must have
been going on in the servants' hall. Some could scarce
keep their eyes open; one or two sat winking at each
other! and others were fairly asleep, and snoring! Under
the circumstances, therefore, the doctor, with much
judgment, read very short prayers, and immediately afterwards
took his departure for his snug little vicarage. The
moon shone brightly, the air was clear and bracing, and
he felt as blithe as a bird as he walked homeward!</p>

<p>The next morning, which proved as fine as the preceding,
Mr. Aubrey was detained in-doors with his letters,
and one or two other little matters of business in his library,
till luncheon time. "What say you, Kate, to a
ride round the country?" said he, on taking his seat.
Kate was delighted; and forthwith the horses were ordered
to be got ready as soon as possible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must not mind a little rough riding, Kate, by
the way," said Aubrey; "for we shall have to get over
some ugly places!&mdash;I'm going to meet Waters at the
end of the avenue, about that old sycamore&mdash;we must
have it down at last."</p>

<p>"Oh no, Charles, no; I thought we had settled that
last year!" replied Kate, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Pho! if it had not been for you, Kate, it would have
been down two years ago at least. Its hour is come at
last; 'tis indeed, so no pouting! It is injuring the other
trees; and, besides, it spoils the prospect from the left
wing of the house."</p>

<p>"'Tis only Waters that puts all these things into your
head, Charles, and I shall let him know <i>my</i> opinion on
the subject when I see him! Mamma, haven't <i>you</i> a
word to say for the old"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But Mr. Aubrey, not deeming it discreet to await the
new force which was being brought against him, started
off to inspect a newly purchased horse, just brought to
the stables.</p>

<p>Kate, who really became everything, looked charming
in her blue riding-habit and hat, sitting on her horse with
infinite ease and grace; in fact, a capital horsewoman.
The exercise soon brought a rich bloom upon her cheek;
and as she cantered along the road by the side of her
brother, no one could have met them without being almost
startled at her beauty. Just as they had dropped
into an easy walk&mdash;</p>

<p>"Charles," said she, observing two horsemen approaching
them, "who can these be? Heavens! did you ever
see such figures? And how they ride!"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," replied her brother, smiling, "they
look a brace of arrant Cockneys! Ah, ha!&mdash;what can
they be doing in <i>these</i> parts?"</p>

<p>"Dear me, what puppies!" exclaimed Miss Aubrey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
lowering her voice as they neared the persons she
spoke of.</p>

<p>"They <i>are</i> certainly a most extraordinary couple!
Who <i>can</i> they be?" said Mr. Aubrey, a smile forcing
itself into his features. One of the gentlemen thus referred
to, was dressed in a light blue surtout, with the
tip of a white pocket-handkerchief seen peeping out of a
pocket in the front of it. His hat, with scarce any brim
to it, was stuck aslant on the top of a bushy head of
queer-colored hair. His shirt-collar was turned down completely
over his stock, displaying a great quantity of dirt-colored
hair under his chin; while a pair of mustaches, of
the same color, were sprouting upon his upper lip, and
a perpendicular tuft depended from his under lip. A
quizzing-glass was stuck in his right eye, and in his hand
he carried a whip with a shining silver head. The other
was almost equally distinguished by the elegance of his
appearance. He had a glossy hat, a purple-colored velvet
waistcoat, two pins connected by little chains in his stock,
a bottle-green surtout, sky-blue trousers, and a most splendid
riding-whip. In short, who should these be but our
old friends, Messrs. Titmouse and Snap? Whoever they
might be&mdash;and whatever their other accomplishments,
it was plain that they were perfect novices on horseback;
and their horses had every appearance of having been much
fretted and worried by their riders. To the surprise of
Mr. Aubrey and his sister, these two personages attempted
to rein in as they neared, and evidently intended to speak
to them.</p>

<p>"Pray&mdash;a&mdash;sir, will you, sir, tell us," commenced
Titmouse, with a desperate attempt to appear at his
ease, as he tried to make his horse stand still for a
moment&mdash;"isn't there a place called&mdash;called"&mdash;here
his horse, whose sides were constantly being galled by
the spurs of its unconscious rider, began to back a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
little; then to go on one side, and, in Titmouse's fright,
his glass dropped from his eye, and he seized hold of the
pommel. Nevertheless, to show the lady how completely
he was at his ease all the while, he levelled a great many
oaths and curses at the unfortunate eyes and soul of his
wayward brute; who, however, not in the least moved by
them, but infinitely disliking the spurs of its rider and
the twisting round of its mouth by the reins, seemed
more and more inclined for mischief, and backed close
up to the edge of the ditch.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid, sir," said Mr. Aubrey, kindly and very
earnestly, "you are not much accustomed to riding.
Will you permit <i>me</i>"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;ye&mdash;ye&mdash;s, sir, I <i>am</i>
though,&mdash;uncommon&mdash;whee-o-uy! whuoy!"&mdash;(then a fresh volley of
oaths.) "Oh, dear, 'pon my soul&mdash;ho! my eyes!&mdash;what&mdash;what
<i>is</i> he going to do! Snap! Snap!"&mdash;'T was,
however, quite in vain to call on <i>that</i> gentleman for assistance;
for he had grown as pale as death, on finding that
his own brute seemed strongly disposed to follow the
infernal example (or rather, as it were, the <i>converse</i> of it)
of the other, and was particularly inclined to rear up on
its hind-legs. The very first motion of that sort brought
Snap's heart (not large enough, perhaps, to choke him)
into his mouth. Titmouse's beast, in the mean while,
suddenly wheeled round; and throwing its hind feet into
the air, sent its terrified rider flying head over heels into
the very middle of the hedge, from which he dropped
into the soft wet ditch on the road-side. Both Mr. Aubrey
and his groom immediately dismounted, and secured
the horse, who, having got rid of its ridiculous rider, stood
perfectly quiet. Titmouse proved to be more frightened
than hurt. His hat was crushed flat on his head, and
half the left side of his face covered with mud&mdash;as, indeed,
were his clothes all the way down. The groom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
(almost splitting with laughter) helped him on his horse
again; and as Mr. and Miss Aubrey were setting off&mdash;"I
think, sir," said the former, politely, "you were inquiring
for some place?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," quoth Snap. "Isn't there a place called
Ya&mdash;Yat&mdash;Yat&mdash;(be quiet, you brute!)&mdash;Yatton
about here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;straight on," replied Mr. Aubrey. Miss
Aubrey hastily threw her veil over her face, to conceal
her laughter, urging on her horse; and she and her
brother were soon out of sight of the strangers.</p>

<p>"I say, Snap," quoth Titmouse, when he had in a
measure cleansed himself, and they had both got a little
composed, "see that lovely gal?"</p>

<p>"Fine gal&mdash;devilish fine!" replied Snap.</p>

<p>"I'm blessed if I don't think&mdash;'pon my life, I believe
we've met before!"</p>

<p>"Didn't seem to know you though!"&mdash;&mdash; quoth Snap,
somewhat dryly.</p>

<p>"Ah! you don't know&mdash;How uncommon infernal unfortunate
to happen just at the moment when"&mdash;&mdash; Titmouse
became silent; for all of a sudden he recollected
when and where, and under what circumstances he had
seen Miss Aubrey before, and which his vanity would not
allow of his telling Snap. The fact was, that she had
once accompanied her sister-in-law to Messrs. Tag-rag and
Company's, to purchase some small matter of mercery.
Titmouse had served them; and his absurdity of manner
and personal appearance had provoked a smile, which Titmouse
a little misconstrued; for when, a Sunday or two
afterwards, he met her in the Park, the little fool actually
had the presumption to nod to her&mdash;she having not the
slightest notion who the little wretch might be&mdash;and of
course not having, on the present occasion, the least
recollection of him. The reader will recollect that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
incident made a deep impression on the mind of Mr. Titmouse.</p>

<p>The coincidence was really not a little singular&mdash;but
to return to Mr. Aubrey and his sister. After riding a
mile or two farther up the road, they leaped over a very
low mound or fence, which formed the extreme boundary
of that part of the estate, and having passed through a
couple of fields, they entered the eastern extremity of that
fine avenue of elms, at the higher end of which stood
Kate's favorite tree, and also Waters and his under-bailiff&mdash;who
looked to her like a couple of executioners, only
awaiting the fiat of her brother. The sun shone brightly
upon the doomed sycamore&mdash;"the axe was laid at its
root." As they rode up the avenue, Kate begged very
hard for mercy; but for once her brother seemed obdurate&mdash;the
tree, he said, <i>must</i> come down&mdash;'t was all nonsense
to think of leaving it standing any longer!&mdash;</p>

<p>"Remember, Charles," said she, passionately, as they
drew up, "how we've all of us romped and sported under
it! Poor papa also"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"See, Kate, how rotten it is," said her brother; and
riding close to it, with his whip he snapped off two or
three of its feeble silvery-gray branches&mdash;"it's high
time for it to come down."</p>

<p>"It fills the grass all round with little branches, sir,
whenever there's the least breath of wind," said Waters.</p>

<p>"It won't hardly hold a crow's weight on the topmost
branches, sir," added Dickons, the under-bailiff, very modestly.</p>

<p>"Had it any leaves last summer?" inquired Mr. Aubrey.</p>

<p>"I don't think, sir," replied Waters, "it had a hundred
all over it!"</p>

<p>"Really, Kate," said her brother, "'t is such a melancholy,
unsightly object, when seen from any part of the
Hall"&mdash;turning round on his horse to look at the rear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
of the Hall, which was at about two hundred yards' distance.
"It looks such an old withered thing among the
fresh green trees around it&mdash;'t is quite a painful contrast."
Kate had gently urged on her horse while her
brother was speaking, till she was close beside him.
"Charles," said she, in a low whisper, "does not it remind
you a little of poor old mamma, with her gray hairs,
among her children and grandchildren? <i>She</i> is not out
of place among us&mdash;is she?" Her eyes filled with tears.
So did her brother's.</p>

<p>"Dearest Kate," said he, with emotion, affectionately
grasping her little hand, "you have triumphed! The old
tree shall never be cut down in my time! Waters, let
the tree stand; and if anything <i>is</i> to be done to it&mdash;let
the greatest possible <i>care</i> be taken of it." Miss Aubrey
turned her head aside to conceal her emotion. Had they
been alone, she would have flung her arms round her
brother's neck.</p>

<p>"If I were to speak my mind, sir," said the compliant
Waters, seeing the turn things were taking, "I should
say, with our young lady, the old tree's quite a kind of
ornament in this here situation, and (as one might say) it
sets off the rest." [It was he who had been worrying Mr.
Aubrey for these last three years to have it cut down!]</p>

<p>"Well," replied Mr. Aubrey, "however that may be,
let me hear no more of cutting it down&mdash;Ah! what does
old Jolter want here?" said he, observing an old tenant of
that name, almost bent double with age, hobbling towards
them. He was wrapped up in a coarse thick blue coat;
his hair was long and white; his eyes dim and glassy with age.</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir&mdash;I'll go and see," said Waters.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Jolter?" he inquired, stepping
forward to meet him.</p>

<p>"Nothing much, sir," replied the old man, feebly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
panting, taking off his hat, and bowing very low towards
Mr. and Miss Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Put your hat on, my old friend," said Mr. Aubrey, kindly.</p>

<p>"I only come to bring you this bit of paper, sir, if you
please," said the old man, addressing Waters. "You said,
a while ago, as how I was always to bring you papers that
were left with me; and this"&mdash;taking one out of his
pocket&mdash;"was left with me only about an hour ago.
It's seemingly a lawyer's paper, and was left by an uncommon
gay young chap. He asked me my name, and
then he looked at the paper, and read it all over to me,
but I couldn't make anything of it."</p>

<p>"What is it?" inquired Mr. Aubrey, as Waters cast
his eye over a sheet of paper, partly printed and partly written.</p>

<p>"Why, it seems the old story, sir&mdash;that slip of waste
land, sir. Mr. Tomkins is at it again, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, if he chooses to spend his money in that way,
I can't help it," said Mr. Aubrey, with a smile. "Let me
look at the paper." He did so. "Yes, it seems the same
kind of thing as before. Well," handing it back, "send
it to Mr. Parkinson, and tell him to look to it; and, at all
events, take care that poor old Jolter comes to no trouble
by the business. How's the old wife, Jacob?"</p>

<p>"She's dreadful bad with rheumatis, sir; but the stuff
that Madam sends her does her a woundy deal of good,
sir, in her inside."</p>

<p>"Well, we must try if we can't send you some more;
and, harkee, if the goodwife doesn't get better soon, send
us up word to the Hall, and we'll have the doctor call
on her. Now, Kate, let us away homeward." And they
were soon out of sight.</p>

<p>I do not intend to deal so unceremoniously or summarily
as Mr. Aubrey did, with the document which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
been brought to his notice by Jolter, then handed over
to Waters, and by him, according to orders, transmitted
the next day to Mr. Parkinson, Mr. Aubrey's attorney.
It was what is called a "<span class="smcap">Declaration in Ejectment</span>;"
touching which, in order to throw a ray or two of light
upon a document which will make no small figure in this
history, I shall try to give the reader a little information
on the point; and hope that a little attention to what
now follows, will be repaid in due time. Here beginneth
a little lecture on law.</p>

<p>If <i>Jones</i> claim a <i>debt</i>, or <i>goods</i>, or <i>damages</i>, from <i>Smith</i>,
one should think that, if he went to law, the action would
be entitled "Jones <i>versus</i> Smith;" and so it is. But behold,
if it be <span class="smcap">land</span> which is claimed by Jones from Smith,
the style and name of the cause stand thus:&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Doe</span>, on
the demise of Jones, <i>versus</i> <span class="smcap">Roe</span>." Instead, therefore, of
Jones and Smith fighting out the matter in their own
proper names, they set up a couple of puppets, (called
"John Doe" and "Richard Roe,") who fall upon one
another in a very quaint fashion, after the manner of
Punch and Judy. John Doe pretends to be the real
plaintiff, and Richard Roe the real defendant. John
Doe says that the land which Richard Roe has, is his,
(the said John Doe's,) because <i>Jones</i> (the real plaintiff)
gave him a lease of it; and <i>Jones</i> is then called "the
lessor of the plaintiff." John Doe further says that one
Richard Roe, (who calls himself by the very significant
and expressive name of a "<i>Casual Ejector</i>,") came and
turned him out, and so John Doe brings his action against
Richard Roe. 'Tis a fact, that whenever land is sought
to be recovered in England, this anomalous and farcical
proceeding must be adopted.[<a href='#Note_15'>15</a>] It is the duty of the <i>real</i>
plaintiff (Jones) to serve on the <i>real</i> defendant (Smith)
a copy of the queer document which I shall proceed to
lay before the reader; and also to append to it an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
affectionate note, intimating the serious consequences which
will ensue upon inattention or contumacy. The "Declaration,"
then, which had been served upon old Jolter, was
in the words, letters, and figures following&mdash;that is to
say:&mdash;</p>

is not yet expired, and ejected him from his said farm, and
other wrongs to the said John Doe there did, to the great
damage of the said John Doe, and against the peace of our
Lord the King, &amp;c.; and Thereupon the said John Doe, by
<span class="smcap">Oily Gammon</span>, his attorney, complains,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That whereas the said <span class="smcap">Tittlebat Titmouse</span>, on the &mdash;th

hold the same to the said John Doe and his assigns thenceforth,
for and during, and unto the full end and term of twenty years
thence next ensuing, and fully to be completed and ended:
By virtue of which said demise, the said John Doe entered
into the said tenements, with the appurtenances, and became
and was thereof possessed for the said term, so to him thereof
granted as aforesaid. And the said John Doe being so thereof
possessed, the said Richard Roe afterwards, to-wit, on the day

with force and arms, that is to say with swords, staves,
and knives, &amp;c., entered into the said tenements, with the

<p>Mr. Parkinson, Mr. Aubrey's solicitor, who resided at
Grilston, the post-town nearest to Yatton, from which it
was distant about six or seven miles, was sitting on the
evening of Tuesday the 28th December 18&mdash;, in his
office, nearly finishing a letter to his London agents,
Messrs. Runnington and Company&mdash;one of the most
eminent firms in the profession&mdash;and which he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
desirous of despatching by that night's mail. Among other
papers which have come into my hands in connection
with this history, I have happened to light on the letter
which he was writing; and as it is not long, and affords
a specimen of the way in which business is carried on
between town and country attorneys and solicitors, here
followeth a copy of it:&mdash;</p>

<p class='center'>"<i>Puddinghead</i> v. <i>Quickwit</i>.</p>

<p>"Plaintiff bought a horse of defendant in November last,
'warranted sound,' and paid for it on the spot £64. A week
afterwards, his attention was accidentally drawn to the animal's
head; and to his infinite surprise, he discovered that the left
eye was a <i>glass eye</i>, so closely resembling the other in color,
that the difference could not be discovered except on a very
close examination. I have seen it myself, and it is indeed
wonderfully well done. My countrymen are certainly pretty
sharp hands in such matters&mdash;but this beats everything I
ever heard of. Surely this is a breach of the warranty? Or is
it to be considered a <i>patent</i> defect, which would not be within
the warranty?[<a href='#Note_17'>17</a>]&mdash;Please take pleader's opinion, and particularly
as to whether the horse could be brought into court to be
viewed by the court and jury, which would have a great effect.

chance with a Yorkshire jury,) if you think the <i>venue</i> is transitory,
and that defendant would not be successful on a motion
to change it. <i>Qu.</i>&mdash;Is the man who sold the horse to defendant
a <i>competent</i>[<a href='#Note_18'>18</a>] <i>witness</i> for the plaintiff, to prove that, when
he sold it to defendant, it had but one eye, and that on this
account the horse was sold for less?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>"I cannot get these parties to come to an amicable settlement.
You may remember, from the two former actions, that
it is for damages on account of two geese of defendant having
been found trespassing on a few yards of a field belonging
to the plaintiff. Defendant now contends that he is entitled to
common, <i>pour cause de vicinage</i>. <i>Qu.</i>&mdash;Can this be shown
under Not Guilty, or must it be pleaded specially?&mdash;About
two years ago, by the way, a pig belonging to plaintiff got into
defendant's flower-garden, and did at least £3 worth of damage&mdash;Can
this be in any way set off against the present action?
There is no hope of avoiding a third trial, as the parties are
now more exasperated against each other than ever, and the
expense (as at least fifteen witnesses will be called on each
side) will amount to upwards of £250. You had better retain

<p>Thus far had the worthy writer proceeded with his
letter, when Waters made his appearance, delivering to
him the declaration in ejectment which had been served
upon old Jolter, and also the instructions concerning it
which had been given by Mr. Aubrey. After Mr. Parkinson
had asked particularly concerning Mr. Aubrey's
health, and what had brought him so suddenly to Yatton,
he cast his eye hastily over the "Declaration"&mdash;and
at once and contemptuously came to the same conclusion
concerning it which had been arrived at by
Waters and Mr. Aubrey, viz. that it was another little
arrow out of the quiver of the litigious Mr. Tomkins.
As soon as Waters had left, Mr. Parkinson thus proceeded
to conclude his letter:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>This letter, lying among some twenty or thirty similar
ones on Mr. Runnington's table, on the morning of its
arrival in town, was opened in its turn; and then, in like
manner, with most of the others, handed over to the managing
clerk, in order that he might inquire into and report
upon the state of the various matters of business
referred to. As to the last item (<i>Doe dem. Titmouse</i> v.
<i>Roe</i>) in Mr. Parkinson's letter, there seemed no particular
reason for hurrying; so two or three days had elapsed
before Mr. Runnington, having some little casual business
to transact with Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap,
bethought himself of looking at his Diary, to see if there
were not something else that he had to do with that very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
sharp "house." Putting, therefore, the Declaration in
<i>Doe d. Titmouse</i> v. <i>Roe</i> into his pocket, it was not long
before he was to be seen at the office in Saffron Hill&mdash;and
in the very room in it which had been the scene of
several memorable interviews between Mr. Tittlebat Titmouse
and Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap. I shall
not detail what transpired on that occasion between Mr.
Runnington, and Messrs. Quirk and Gammon, with whom
he was closeted for nearly an hour. On quitting the
office his cheek was flushed, and his manner somewhat
excited. After walking a little way in a moody manner
and with slow step, he suddenly jumped into a hackney-coach,
and within a quarter of an hour's time had secured
an inside place in the Tally-ho coach, which started for
York at two o'clock that afternoon&mdash;much doubting
within himself, the while, whether he ought not to have
set off at once in a post-chaise and four. He then made
one or two calls in the Temple; and, hurrying home to
the office, made hasty arrangements for his sudden journey
into Yorkshire. He was a calm and experienced
man&mdash;in fact, a first-rate man of business; and you
may be assured that this rapid and decisive movement of
his had been the result of some very startling disclosure
made to him by Messrs. Quirk and Gammon.</p>

<p>Now, let us glide back to the delightful solitude which
we reluctantly quitted so short a time ago.</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey was a studious and ambitious man; and in
acceding so readily to the wishes of his wife and sister,
to spend the Christmas recess at Yatton, had been not
a little influenced by one consideration, which he had
not thought it worth while to mention&mdash;namely, that
it would afford him an opportunity of addressing himself
with effect to a very important and complicated question,
which was to be brought before the House shortly after
its reassembling, and of which he then knew, comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
speaking, nothing at all. For this purpose he had
had a quantity of Parliamentary papers, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.,
packed up and sent down by coach; and he quite gloated
over the prospect of their being duly deposited upon his
table, in the tranquil leisure of his library, at Yatton.
But quietly as he supposed all this to have been managed,
Mrs. Aubrey and Kate had a most accurate knowledge
of his movements, and resolved within themselves,
(being therein comforted and assisted by old Mrs. Aubrey,)
that, as at their instances Mr. Aubrey had come
down to Yatton, so they would take care that he should
have not merely nominal, but real holidays. Unless
he thought fit to rise at an early hour in the morning,
(which Mrs. Aubrey, junior, took upon herself to say <i>she</i>
would take care should never be the case,) it was decreed
that he should not be allowed to waste more than two
hours a-day alone in his library. 'T&nbsp;was therefore in vain
for him to sit at breakfast with eye aslant and thought-laden
brow, as if meditating a long day's seclusion; somehow
or another, he never got above an hour to himself.
He was often momentarily petulant on these occasions,
and soon saw through the designs of his enemies; but he
so heartily and tenderly loved them&mdash;so thoroughly appreciated
the affection which dictated their little man&oelig;uvres&mdash;that
he soon surrendered at discretion, and,
in fact, placed himself almost entirely at their mercy;
resolving to make up for lost time on his return to town,
and earnestly hoping that the interests of the nation
would not suffer in the mean while! In short, the ladies
of Yatton had agreed on their line of operations: that
almost every night of their stay in the country should be
devoted either to entertaining or visiting their neighbors;
and as a preparatory movement, that the days (weather
permitting) should be occupied with exercise in the open
air; in making "morning" calls on neighbors at several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
miles' distance from the Hall and from each other; and
from which they generally returned only in time enough
to dress for dinner. As soon, indeed, as the <i>York True
Blue</i> (the leading county paper) had announced the arrival
at Yatton of "Charles Aubrey, Esq., M. P., and his
family, for the Christmas recess," the efforts of Mrs. and
Miss Aubrey were most powerfully seconded by a constant
succession of visitors&mdash;by</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Troops of friends,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>as the lodge-keeper could have testified; for he and his
buxom wife were continually opening and shutting the
great gates. On the Monday after Christmas-day, (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the
day but one following,) came cantering up to the Hall Lord
De la Zouch and Mr. Delamere, of course staying to luncheon
and bearing a most pressing invitation from Lady De
la Zouch, zealously backed by themselves, for the Aubreys
to join a large party at Fotheringham Castle on New-Year's
Eve. This was accepted&mdash;a day and a night were thus
gone at a swoop. The same thing happened with the Oldfields,
their nearest neighbors; with Sir Percival Pickering
at Luddington Court, where was a superb new picture-gallery
to be critically inspected by Mr. Aubrey&mdash;the Earl
of Oldacre, a college friend of Mr. Aubrey's&mdash;the venerable
Lady Stratton, the earliest friend and schoolfellow of
old Mrs. Aubrey, and so forth. Then Kate had several visits
to pay on her own account; and being fond of horseback,
but not of riding about the country with only a
groom in attendance, her brother <i>must</i> accompany her on
these occasions. The first week of their stay in the country
was devoted to visiting their neighbors and friends in
the way I have stated; the next was to be spent in receiving
them at Yatton, during which time the old Hall was
to ring with merry hospitality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there was a little world of other matters to occupy
Mr. Aubrey's attention, and which naturally crowded upon
him, living so little as he had latterly lived at Yatton. He
often had a kind of levee of his humbler neighbors, tenants,
and constituents; and on these occasions his real
goodness of nature, his simplicity, his patience, his forbearance,
his sweetness of temper, his benevolence, shone
conspicuous. With all these more endearing qualities,
there was yet a placid dignity about him which would
have chilled undue familiarity, and repelled presumption&mdash;had
they ventured to manifest themselves. He had
here no motive or occasion for ostentation, or, as it is
called, popularity-hunting. In a sense it might be said of
him, that he was "monarch of all he surveyed." It is
true, he was member for the borough&mdash;an honor, however,
for which he was indebted to the natural influence of
his commanding position&mdash;one which left him his own
master, not converting him into a paltry delegate, handcuffed
by pledges on public questions, and laden with injunctions
concerning petty local interests only&mdash;liable,
moreover, to be called to an account at any moment by
ignorant and insolent demagogues&mdash;but a member of
Parliament training to become a statesman, possessed of
a free-will, and therefore capable of independent and enlightened
deliberations; placed by his fortune above the
reach of temptation&mdash;but I shall not go any farther, for
the portraiture of a member of Parliament of those days
suggests such a humiliating and bitter contrast, that I
shall not ruffle either my own or my reader's temper by
sketching one of modern days. On the occasions I have
been alluding to, Mr. Aubrey was not only condescending
and generous, but practically acute and discriminating;
qualities of his, these latter, so well known, however, as
to leave him at length scarce any opportunities of exercising
them. His quiet but decisive interference put an end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
to many local unpleasantnesses and annoyances, and caused
his increasing absence from Yatton to be very deeply regretted.
Was a lad or a wench taking to idle and dissolute
courses? A kind, or, as the occasion required, a stern
expostulation of his&mdash;for he was a justice of the peace
moreover&mdash;brought them to their senses. He had a very
happy knack of reasoning and laughing quarrelsome neighbors
into reconciliation and good-humor. He had a keen
eye after the practical details of agriculture; was equally
quick at detecting an inconvenience, and appreciating&mdash;sometimes
even suggesting&mdash;a remedy; and had, on several
occasions, brought such knowledge to bear very effectively
upon discussions in Parliament. His constituents,
few in number undoubtedly, and humble, were quite satisfied
with, and proud of, their member; and his unexpected
appearance diffused among them real and general satisfaction.
As a landlord, he was beloved by his numerous
tenantry; and well he might&mdash;for never was there so
easy and liberal a landlord: he might at any time have
increased his rental by £1,500 or £2,000 a-year, as his
steward frequently intimated to him&mdash;but in vain. "Ten
thousand a-year," would say Mr. Aubrey, "is far more
than my necessities require&mdash;it affords me and my family
every luxury that I can conceive of; and its magnitude
reminds me constantly that hereafter I shall be called
upon to give a very strict and solemn account of <i>my</i> stewardship."
I would my space could admit of my completing,
as it ought to be completed, this portraiture of a true
Christian gentleman!</p>

<p>As he rode up to the Hare and Hounds Inn, at Grilston,
one morning, to transact some little business, and also to
look in on the Farmers' Club, which was then holding one
of its fortnightly meetings, (every one touching his hat
and bowing to him on each side of the long street, as he
slowly passed up it,) he perceived that his horse limped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
on one foot. On dismounting, therefore, he stopped to see
what was the matter, while his groom took up the foot to
examine it.</p>

<p>"Dey-vilish fine horse!" exclaimed the voice of one
standing close beside him, and in a tone of most disagreeable
confidence. The exclamation was addressed to Mr.
Aubrey; who, on turning to the speaker, beheld a young
man&mdash;('twas, in fact, Titmouse)&mdash;dressed in a style of
the most extravagant absurdity. One hand was stuck into
the hinder pocket of a stylish top-coat, (the everlasting tip
of a white pocket-handkerchief glistening at the mouth of
his breast-pocket;) the other held a cigar to his mouth,
from which, as he addressed Mr. Aubrey with an air of
signal assurance, he slowly expelled the smoke which he
had inhaled. Mr. Aubrey turned towards him with a
cold and surprised air, without replying; at the same
time wondering where he had seen the ridiculous object before.</p>

<p>"The horses in these parts ar'n't to be compared with
them at London&mdash;eh, sir?" quoth Titmouse, approaching
closer to Mr. Aubrey and his groom, to see what the
latter was doing&mdash;who, on hearing Titmouse's last sally,
gave him a very significant look.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the people here won't relish your remarks,
sir!" replied Mr. Aubrey, calmly&mdash;hardly able to forbear
a smile; at the same time, with an astonished air,
scanning the figure of his companion from head to foot.</p>

<p>"Who cares?" inquired Titmouse, with a very energetic
oath. At this moment up came a farmer, who, observing
Mr. Aubrey, made him a very low bow. Mr.
Aubrey's attention being at the moment occupied with
Titmouse, he did not observe the salutation; not so with
Titmouse, who, conceiving it to have been directed to himself,
acknowledged it by taking off his hat with great grace!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Mr. Aubrey presently entered the house, having ordered
his groom to bring back the horse in an hour's time.</p>

<p>"Pray," said he, mildly, to the landlady, "who is that
person smoking the cigar outside?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir," she replied, "he's a Mr. <i>Brown</i>; and has another
with him here&mdash;who's going up to London by this
afternoon's coach&mdash;this one stays behind a day or two
longer. They're queer people, sir. Such dandies! Do
nothing but smoke, and drink brandy and water, sir;
only that t'&nbsp;other writes a good deal."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish you would remind him," said Mr. Aubrey,
smiling, "that, if he thinks fit to speak to <i>me</i> again,
or in my presence, I am a magistrate, and have the power
of fining him five shillings for every oath he utters."</p>

<p>"What! sir," quoth she, reverently&mdash;"has he been
speaking to <i>you</i>? Well, I never!! He's the most forward
little upstart I ever see'd!" said she, dropping her
voice; "and the sooner he takes himself off from here the
better; for he's always winking at the maids and talking
impudence to them. I'se box his ears, I warrant him, one
of these times!" Mr. Aubrey smiled, and went up-stairs.</p>

<p>"There don't seem to be <i>much</i> wrong," quoth Titmouse
to the groom, with a condescending air, as soon as Mr.
Aubrey had entered the house.</p>

<p>"Much you know about it, I don't guess!" quoth Sam,
with a contemptuous smile.</p>

<p>"Who's your master, fellow?" inquired Titmouse,
knocking off the ashes from the tip of his cigar.</p>

<p>"A gentleman. What's <i>yours</i>?"</p>

<p>"Curse your impudence, you vagabond"&mdash;&mdash; The words
were hardly out of his mouth before Sam, with a slight
tap of his hand, had knocked Titmouse's glossy hat off his
head, and Titmouse's purple-hued hair stood exposed to
view, provoking the jeers and laughter of one or two bystanders.
Titmouse appeared about to strike the groom;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
who, hastily giving the bridles of his horses into the hands
of an hostler, threw himself into boxing attitude; and being
a clean, tight-built, stout young fellow, looked a very
formidable object, as he came squaring nearer and nearer
to the dismayed Titmouse; and on behalf of the outraged
honor of all the horses of Yorkshire, was just going to let
fly his <i>one-two</i>, when a sharp tapping at the bow-window
overhead startled him for a moment, interrupting his war-like
demonstrations; and, on casting up his eyes, he beheld
the threatening figure of his master, who was shaking his
whip at him. He dropped his guard, touched his hat very
humbly, and resumed his horses' bridles; muttering, however,
to Titmouse, "If thou'rt a man, come down into
t'&nbsp;yard, and I'll mak thee think a horse kicked thee, a
liar as thou art!"</p>

<p>"Who's that gentleman gone up-stairs?" inquired Titmouse
of the landlady, after he had sneaked into the inn.</p>

<p>"Squire Aubrey of Yatton," she replied tartly. Titmouse's
face, previously very pale, flushed all over. "Ay,
ay," she continued sharply&mdash;"thou <i>must</i> be chattering
to the grand folks, and thou'st nearly put thy foot
into 't&nbsp;at last, I can tell thee; for that's a magistrate,
and thou'st been a-swearing afore him." Titmouse smiled
rather faintly; and entering the parlor, affected to be engaged
with a county newspaper; and he remained very
quiet for upwards of an hour, not venturing out of the
room till he had seen off Mr. Aubrey and his formidable Sam.</p>

<p>It was the hunting season; but Mr. Aubrey, though he
had as fine horses as were to be found in the county, and
which were always at the service of his friends, partly
from want of inclination, and partly from the delicacy of
his constitution, never shared in the sports of the field.
Now and then, however, he rode to cover, to see the
hounds throw off, and exchange greetings with a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
number of his friends and neighbors, on such occasions
collected together. This he did, the morning after that
on which he had visited Grilston, accompanied, at their
earnest entreaty, by Mrs. Aubrey and Kate. I am not
painting angels, but describing frail human nature; and
truth forces me to say, that Kate had a kind of a notion
that on such occasions she did not appear to disadvantage.
I protest I love her not the less for it! Is there a beautiful
woman under the sun who is not really aware of her
charms, and of the effect they produce upon our sex?
Pooh! I never will believe to the contrary. In Kate's
composition this ingredient was but an imperceptible alloy
in virgin gold. Now, how was it that she came to think
of this hunting appointment? I do not exactly know;
but I recollect that when Lord De la Zouch last called at
Yatton, he happened to mention it at lunch, and to say
that he and one Geoffrey Lovel Delamere&mdash;&mdash; but however
that may be, behold, on a bright Thursday morning,
Aubrey and his two lovely companions made their welcome
appearance at the field, superbly mounted, and most
cordially greeted by all present. Miss Aubrey attracted
universal admiration; but there was one handsome youngster,
his well-formed figure showing to great advantage in
his new pink and leathers, who made a point of challenging
her special notice, and in doing so, attracting that of
all his envious fellow-sportsmen; and that was Delamere.
He seemed, indeed, infinitely more taken up with the
little party from Yatton than with the serious business of
the day. His horse, however, had an eye to business;
and with erect ears, catching the first welcome signal
sooner than the gallant person who sat upon it, sprang
off like lightning and would have left its abstracted <i>rider</i>
behind, had he not been a first-rate "<i>seat</i>." In fact, Kate
herself was not sufficiently on her guard; and her eager
filly suddenly put in requisition all her rider's little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
and skill to rein her in&mdash;which having done,
Kate's eye looked rather anxiously after her late companion,
who, however, had already cleared the first hedge, and
was fast making up to the scattering scarlet crowd. Oh,
the bright exhilarating scene!</p>

<p>"Heigh ho&mdash;Agnes!" said Kate, with a slight sigh, as
soon as Delamere had disappeared&mdash;"I was very nearly off."</p>

<p>"So was somebody else, Kate!" said Mrs. Aubrey, with
a sly smile.</p>

<p>"This is a very cool contrivance of yours, Kate,&mdash;- bringing
us here this morning," said her brother, rather gravely.</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you mean, Charles?" she inquired, slightly
reddening. He good-naturedly tapped her shoulder with
his whip, laughed, urged his horse into a canter, and they
were all soon on their way to General Grim's, an old friend
of the late Mr. Aubrey's.</p>

<p>The party assembled on New-Year's Eve at Fotheringham
Castle, the magnificent residence of Lord De la Zouch,
was numerous and brilliant. The Aubreys arrived about
five o'clock; and on emerging from their respective apartments
into the drawing-room, soon after the welcome
sound of the dinner bell&mdash;Mr. Aubrey leading in his
lovely wife, followed shortly afterwards by his beautiful
sister&mdash;they attracted general attention. He himself
looked handsome, for the brisk country air had brought
out a glow upon his too frequently pallid countenance&mdash;pallid
with the unwholesome atmosphere, the late hours,
the wasting excitement of the House of Commons; and
his smile was cheerful, his eye bright and penetrating.
Nothing makes such quick triumphant way in English
society, as the promise of speedy political distinction. It
will supply to its happy possessor the want of family and
fortune&mdash;it rapidly melts away all distinctions. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
obscure but eloquent commoner finds himself suddenly
standing in the rarefied atmosphere of privilege and exclusiveness&mdash;the
familiar equal, often the conscious superior,
of the haughtiest peer of the realm. A single successful
speech in the House of Commons, opens before its utterer
the shining doors of fashion and greatness as if by magic.
It is as it were <span class="smcap">Power</span> stepping into its palace, welcomed
by gay crowds of eager, obsequious expectants. Who
would not press forward to grasp in anxious welcome the
hand which, in a few short years, may dispense the glittering
baubles sighed after by the great, and the more
substantial patronage of office&mdash;which may point public
opinion in any direction? But, to go no farther, what if
to all this be added a previous position in society, such as
that occupied by Mr. Aubrey! There were several very
fine women, married and single, in that splendid drawing-room;
but there were two girls, in very different styles of
beauty, who were soon allowed by all present to carry off
the palm between them&mdash;I mean Miss Aubrey and Lady
Caroline Caversham, the only daughter of the Marchioness
of Redborough, both of whom were on a visit at the castle
of some duration. Lady Caroline and Miss Aubrey were of
about the same age, and dressed almost exactly alike,
viz. in white satin; only Lady Caroline wore a brilliant
diamond necklace, whereas Kate had chosen to wear not
a single ornament.</p>

<p>Lady Caroline was a trifle the taller, and had a very
stately carriage. Her hair was black as jet&mdash;her features
were refined and delicate; but they wore a very cold,
haughty expression. After a glance at her half-closed
eyes, and the swan-like curve of her snowy neck, you unconsciously
withdrew from her, as from an inaccessible
beauty. The more you looked at her, the more she satisfied
your critical scrutiny; but your <i>feelings</i> went not
out towards her&mdash;they were, in a manner, chilled and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
repulsed. Look, now, at our own Kate Aubrey&mdash;nay,
never fear to place her beside yon supercilious divinity&mdash;look
at her, and your <i>heart</i> acknowledges her loveliness;
your soul thrills at sight of her bewitching blue eyes&mdash;eyes
now sparkling with excitement, then languishing with
softness, in accordance with the varying emotions of a
sensitive nature&mdash;a most susceptible heart. How her
sunny curls harmonize with the delicacy and richness of
her complexion! Her figure, observe, is, of the two, a
trifle fuller than her rival's&mdash;stay, don't let your admiring
eyes settle so intently upon her budding form, or you
will confuse Kate&mdash;turn away, or she will shrink from
you like the sensitive plant! Lady Caroline seems the
exquisite but frigid production of a skilful statuary, who
had caught a divinity in the very act of disdainfully setting
her foot for the first time upon this poor earth of
ours; but Kate is a living and breathing beauty&mdash;as it
were, fresh from the hand of God himself!</p>

<p>Kate was very affectionately greeted by Lady De la
Zouch, a lofty and dignified woman of about fifty; so
also by Lord De la Zouch; but when young Delamere
welcomed her with a palpable embarrassment of manner,
a more brilliant color stole into her cheek, and a
keen observer might have noticed a little, rapid, undulating
motion in her bosom, which told of some inward
emotion. And a keen observer Kate at that moment had
in her beautiful rival; from whose cheek, as that of Kate
deepened in its roseate bloom, faded away the color entirely,
leaving it the hue of the lily. Her drooping eyelids
could scarcely conceal the glances of alarm and anger
which she darted at her plainly successful rival in the affections
of the future Lord De la Zouch. Kate was quickly
aware of this state of matters; and it required no little
self-control to appear <i>un</i>aware of it. Delamere took her
down to dinner, and seated himself beside her, and paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
her such pointed attentions as at length really distressed
her; and she was quite relieved when the time came for
the ladies to withdraw. That she had not a secret yearning
towards Delamere, the frequent companion of her early
days, I cannot assert, because I know it would be contrary
to the fact. Circumstances had kept him on the
Continent for more than a year between the period of his
quitting Eton and going to Oxford, where another twelve-month
had slipped away without his visiting Yorkshire:
thus two years had elapsed&mdash;and behold Kate had become
a woman and he a man! They had mutual predispositions
towards each other, and 'twas mere accident
which of them first manifested symptoms of fondness for
the other&mdash;the same result must have followed, namely,
(to use a great word,) reciprocation. Lord and Lady De la
Zouch idolized their son, and were old and very firm friends
of the Aubrey family; and, if Delamere really formed an
attachment to one of Miss Aubrey's beauty, accomplishments,
talent, amiability, and ancient family&mdash;why should
he not be gratified? Kate, whether she would or not, was
set down to the piano, Lady Caroline accompanying her
on the harp&mdash;on which she usually performed with mingled
skill and grace; but on the present occasion, both
the fair performers found fault with their instruments&mdash;then
with themselves&mdash;and presently gave up the attempt
in despair. But when, at a later period of the evening,
Kate's spirits had been a little exhilarated with dancing,
and she sat down, at Lord De la Zouch's request, and
gave that exquisite song from the <i>Tempest</i>&mdash;"Where the
bee sucks"&mdash;all the witchery of her voice and manner
had returned; and as for Delamere, he would have given
the world to marry her that minute, and so forever extinguish
the hopes of&mdash;as he imagined&mdash;two or three
nascent competitors for the beautiful prize then present.</p>

<p>That Kate was good as beautiful, the following little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
incident, which happened to her on the ensuing evening,
will show. There was a girl in the village at Yatton,
about sixteen or seventeen years old, called Ph&oelig;be Williams;
a very pretty girl, and who had spent about two
years at the Hall as a laundry-maid, but had been obliged,
some few months before the time I am speaking of, to
return to her parents in the village, ill of a decline. She
had been a sweet-tempered girl in her situation, and all
her fellow-servants felt great interest in her, as also did
Miss Aubrey. Mrs. Aubrey sent her daily jellies, sago,
and other such matters, suitable for the poor girl's condition;
and about a quarter of an hour after her return
from Fotheringham, Miss Aubrey, finding one of the female
servants about to set off with some of the above-mentioned
articles, and hearing that poor Ph&oelig;be was
getting rapidly worse, instead of retiring to her room
to undress, slipped on an additional shawl, and resolved
to accompany the servant to the village. She said not
a word to either her mother, her sister-in-law, or her
brother; but simply left word with her maid whither
she was going, and that she should quickly return. It
was snowing smartly when Kate set off; but she cared
not, hurried on by the impulse of kindness, which led her
to pay perhaps a last visit to the humble sufferer. She
walked alongside of the elderly female servant, asking her
a number of questions about Ph&oelig;be, and her sorrowing
father and mother. It was nearly dark as they quitted
the Park gates, and snowing, if anything, faster than when
they had left the Hall. Kate, wrapping her shawl still
closer round her slender figure, her face being pretty well
protected by her veil, hurried on, and they soon reached
Williams' cottage. Its humble tenants were, as may be
imagined, not a little surprised at her appearance at such
an hour and in such inclement weather, and so apparently
unattended. Poor Ph&oelig;be, worn to a shadow, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
sitting opposite the fire, in a little wooden armchair,
and propped up by a pillow. She trembled, and her
lips moved on seeing Miss Aubrey, who, sitting down
on a stool beside her, after laying aside her snow-whitened
shawl and bonnet, spoke to her in the most
gentle and soothing strain imaginable. What a contrast
in their two figures! 'T&nbsp;would have been no violent
stretch of imagination to say, that Catherine Aubrey at
that moment looked like a ministering angel sent to
comfort the wretched sufferer in her extremity. Ph&oelig;be's
father and mother stood on each side of the little fireplace,
gazing with tearful eyes upon their only child, soon about
to depart from them forever. The poor girl was indeed a
touching object. She had been very pretty, but now her
face was white and wofully emaciated&mdash;the dread impress
of consumption was upon it. Her wasted fingers were
clasped together on her lap, holding between them a little
handkerchief, with which, evidently with great effort,
she occasionally wiped the dampness from her face.</p>

<p>"You're very good, ma'am," she whispered, "to come
to see me, and so late. They say it's a sad cold night."</p>

<p>"I heard, Ph&oelig;be, that you were not so well, and I
thought I would just step along with Margaret, who
has brought you some more jelly. Did you like the last!"</p>

<p>"Y-e-s, ma'am," she replied hesitatingly; "but it's
<i>very</i> hard for me to swallow anything now, my throat
feels so sore." Here her mother shook her head and
looked aside; for the doctor had only that morning
explained to her the nature of the distressing symptom
to which her daughter was alluding&mdash;as evidencing the
very last stage of her fatal disorder.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry to hear you say so, Ph&oelig;be," replied
Miss Aubrey. "Do you think there's anything else that
Mrs. Jackson could make for you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, ma'am, thank you; I feel it's no use trying to
swallow anything more," said poor Ph&oelig;be, faintly.</p>

<p>"While there's life," whispered Miss Aubrey, in a
subdued, hesitating tone, "there's hope&mdash;<i>they say</i>."
Ph&oelig;be shook her head mournfully.</p>

<p>"Don't stop long, dear lady&mdash;it's getting very late
for you to be out alone. Father will go"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never mind me, Ph&oelig;be&mdash;I can take care of myself.
I hope you mind what good Dr. Tatham says to you?
You know this sickness is from God, Ph&oelig;be. He knows
what is best for his creatures."</p>

<p>"Thank God, ma'am, I think I feel resigned. I know
it is God's will; but I'm very sorry for poor father and
mother&mdash;they'll be so lone like when they don't see
Ph&oelig;be about." Her father gazed intently at her, and
the tears ran trickling down his cheeks; her mother
put her apron before her face, and shook her head in
silent anguish. Miss Aubrey did not speak for a few
moments. "I see you have been reading the prayer-book
mamma gave you when you were at the Hall,"
said she at length, observing the little volume lying
open on Ph&oelig;be's lap.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am&mdash;I was <i>trying</i>; but somehow lately, I
can't read, for there's a kind of mist comes over my eyes,
and I can't see."</p>

<p>"That's weakness, Ph&oelig;be," said Miss Aubrey, quickly
but tremulously.</p>

<p>"May I make bold, ma'am," commenced Ph&oelig;be, languidly,
after a hesitating pause, "to ask <i>you</i> to read the
little psalm I was trying to read a while ago? I should
so like to hear <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"I'll try, Ph&oelig;be," said Miss Aubrey, taking the book,
which was open at the sixth psalm. 'Twas a severe
trial, for her feelings were not a little excited already. But
how could she refuse the dying girl? So Miss Aubrey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
began a little indistinctly, in a very low tone, and with
frequent pauses; for the tears every now and then quite
obscured her sight. She managed, however, to get as far
as the sixth verse, which was thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>"I am weary of my groaning: every night wash I my bed, and
water my couch with tears: My beauty is gone for very trouble."</i></p></div>

<p>Here Kate's voice suddenly stopped. She buried her
face for a moment or two in her handkerchief, and said
hastily, "I can't read any more, Ph&oelig;be!" Every one
in the little room was in tears except poor Ph&oelig;be, who
seemed past that.</p>

<p>"It's time for me to go, now, Ph&oelig;be. We'll send
some one early in the morning to know how you are,"
said Miss Aubrey, rising and putting on her bonnet and
shawl. She contrived to beckon Ph&oelig;be's mother to the
back of the room, and silently slipped a couple of guineas
into her hands; for she knew the mournful occasion there
would soon be for such assistance! She then left, peremptorily
declining the attendance of Ph&oelig;be's father&mdash;saying
that it <i>must</i> be dark when she could not find the
way to the Hall, which was almost in a straight line from
the cottage, and little more than a quarter of a mile off.
It was very much darker, and it still snowed, though not
so thickly as when she had come. She and Margaret
walked side by side, at a quick pace, talking together
about poor Ph&oelig;be. Just as she was approaching the
extremity of the village, nearest the park&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! my lovely gals!" exclaimed a voice, in a low but
most offensive tone&mdash;"alone? How uncommon"&mdash;Miss
Aubrey for a moment seemed thunderstruck at so sudden
and unprecedented an occurrence: then she hurried on
with a beating heart, whispering to Margaret to keep
close to her, and not to be alarmed. The speaker, however,
kept pace with them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lovely gals!&mdash;wish I'd an umbrella, my angels!&mdash;Take
my arm? Ah! Pretty gals!"</p>

<p>"Who <i>are</i> you, sir?" at length exclaimed Kate,
spiritedly, suddenly stopping, and turning to the
rude speaker.</p>

<p>[Who else should it be but Tittlebat Titmouse!]
"Who am I? Ah, ha! Lovely gals! one that loves the
pretty gals!"</p>

<p>"Do you know, fellow, who I am?" inquired Miss
Aubrey, indignantly, flinging aside her veil, and disclosing
her beautiful face, white as death, but indistinctly visible
in the darkness, to her insolent assailant.</p>

<p>"No, 'pon my soul, no; but lovely gal! lovely gal!&mdash;'pon
my life, spirited gal!&mdash;do you no harm! Take my arm?"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wretch! ruffian! How dare you insult a lady in
this manner? Do you know who I am? My name, sir,
is Aubrey&mdash;I am Miss Aubrey of the Hall! Do not think"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Titmouse felt as if he were on the point of dropping
down dead at that moment, with amazement and terror;
and when Miss Aubrey's servant screamed out at the top
of her voice, "Help!&mdash;help, there!" Titmouse, without
uttering a syllable more, took to his heels, just as the
door of a cottage, at only a few yards' distance, opened,
and out rushed a strapping farmer, shouting&mdash;"Hey!
what be t'&nbsp;matter?" You may guess his amazement on
discovering Miss Aubrey, and his fury at learning the
cause of her alarm. Out of doors he pelted, without his
hat, uttering a volley of fearful imprecations, and calling
on the unseen miscreant to come forward; for whom it
was lucky that he had time to escape from a pair of fists
that in a minute or two would have beaten his little carcass
into a jelly! Miss Aubrey was so overcome by the
shock she had suffered, that but for a glass of water she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
might have fainted. As soon as she had a little recovered
from her agitation, she set off home, accompanied
by Margaret, and followed very closely by the farmer,
with a tremendous knotted stick under his arm&mdash;(he
wanted to have taken his double-barrelled gun)&mdash;and
thus she soon reached the Hall, not a little tired and
agitated. This little incident, however, she kept to herself,
and enjoined her two attendants to do the same;
for she knew the distress it would have occasioned those
whom she loved. As it was she was somewhat sharply
rebuked by her mother and brother, who had just sent two
servants out in quest of her, and whom it was singular
that she should have missed. This is not the place to
give an account of the eccentric movements of our friend
Titmouse; still there can be no harm in my just mentioning
that the sight of Miss Aubrey on horseback had
half maddened the little fool; her image had never been
effaced from his memory since the occasion on which, as
already explained, he had first seen her; and as soon as
he had ascertained, through Snap's inquiries, who she
was, he became more frenzied in the matter than before,
because he thought he now saw a probability of obtaining
her. "If, like children," says Edmund Burke, "we will
cry for the moon, why, like children, we must&mdash;<i>cry on</i>."
Whether this was not something like the position of Mr.
Tittlebat Titmouse, in his passion for <span class="smcap">Catherine Aubrey</span>,
the reader can judge. He had unbosomed himself in the
matter to his confidential adviser, Mr. Snap; who, having
accomplished his errand, had the day before returned to
town, very much against his will, leaving Titmouse behind,
to bring about, by his own delicate and skilful
management, an union between himself, as the future
lord of Yatton, and the beautiful sister of its present occupant.</p>

<hr class='chapter' />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p>Mr. Aubrey and Kate, some day or two after the strange
occurrence narrated in the last chapter, were sitting together
playing at chess, about eight o'clock in the evening;
Dr. Tatham and Mrs. Aubrey, junior, looking on
with much interest; old Mrs. Aubrey being engaged in
writing. Mr. Aubrey was sadly an overmatch for poor
Kate&mdash;he being in fact a first-rate player; and her soft
white hand had been hovering over the three or four chessmen
she had left, uncertain which of them to move, for
nearly two minutes, her chin resting on the other hand,
and her face wearing a very puzzled expression. "Come,
Kate," said every now and then her brother, with that
calm victorious smile which at such a moment would
have tried any but so sweet a temper as his sister's. "If
<i>I</i> were you, Miss Aubrey," was perpetually exclaiming
Dr. Tatham, knowing as much about the game the while
as the little Blenheim spaniel lying asleep at Miss
Aubrey's feet. "Oh dear!" said Kate, at length, with a
sigh, "I really don't see how to escape"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who can that be?" exclaimed Mrs. Aubrey, looking
up and listening to the sound of carriage wheels.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said her husband, who was interested
in the game&mdash;"come, come, Kate." A few minutes
afterwards a servant made his appearance, and coming
up to Mr. Aubrey, told him that Mr. Parkinson and
another gentleman had called, and were waiting in the
library to speak to him on business.</p>

<p>"What can they want at this hour?" exclaimed Mr.
Aubrey, absently, intently watching an anticipated move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
of his sister's, which would have decided the game in his
favor. At length she made her long-meditated descent&mdash;but
in quite an unexpected quarter.</p>

<p>"Checkmate!" she exclaimed with infinite glee.</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried he, rising with a slightly surprised and
chagrined air, "I'm ruined! Now, try your hand on
Dr. Tatham, while I go and speak to these people. I
wonder what can possibly have brought them here. Oh,
I see&mdash;I see; 'tis probably about Miss Evelyn's marriage-settlement&mdash;I'm
to be one of her trustees." With
this he left the room, and presently entered the library,
where were two gentlemen, one of whom, a stranger, was
in the act of pulling off his great-coat. It was Mr.
Runnington; a tall, thin, elderly man, with short gray
hair&mdash;of gentlemanly appearance&mdash;his countenance
bespeaking the calm, acute, clear-headed man of business.
The other was Mr. Parkinson; a thoroughly respectable,
substantial-looking, hard-headed family solicitor and
country attorney.</p>

<p>"Mr. Runnington, my London agent, sir," said he to
Mr. Aubrey, as the latter entered. Mr. Aubrey bowed.</p>

<p>"Pray, gentlemen, be seated," he replied with his
usual urbanity of manner, taking a chair beside them.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Parkinson, you look very serious&mdash;both
of you. What is the matter?" he inquired surprisedly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Runnington, sir, has arrived, most unexpectedly
to me," replied Mr. Parkinson, "only an hour or two
ago, from London, on business of the last importance
to you."</p>

<p>"<i>To me!</i>&mdash;well, what is it? Pray, say at once what
it is&mdash;I am all attention," said Mr. Aubrey, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Do you happen," commenced Mr. Parkinson, very
nervously, "to remember sending Waters to me on Monday
or Tuesday last, with a paper which had been served
by some one on old Jolter?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Mr. Aubrey, after a moment's consideration.</p>

<p>"Mr. Runnington's errand is connected with that document,"
said Mr. Parkinson, and paused.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Mr. Aubrey, apparently a little
relieved. "I assure you, gentlemen, you very greatly
over-estimate the importance I attach to anything that
such a troublesome person as Mr. Tomkins can do, if I am
right in supposing that it is he who&mdash;Well, then, what <i>is</i>
the matter?" he inquired quickly, observing Mr. Parkinson
shake his head, and interchange a grave look with Mr.
Runnington; "you cannot think, Mr. Parkinson, how
you will oblige me by being explicit."</p>

<p>"This paper," said Mr. Runnington, holding up that
which Mr. Aubrey at once identified as the one on which
he had cast his eye upon its being handed to him by
Waters, "is a Declaration in Ejectment, with which Mr.
Tomkins has nothing whatever to do. It is served virtually
on <i>you</i>, and <span class="smcap">you</span> are the real defendant."</p>

<p>"So I apprehend that I was in the former trumpery
action!" replied Mr. Aubrey, smiling.</p>

<p>"Do you recollect, sir," said Mr. Parkinson, with a
trepidation which he could not conceal, "several years
ago, some serious conversation which you and I had together
on the state of your title&mdash;when I was preparing
your marriage-settlements?"</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey started, and his face was suddenly blanched.</p>

<p>"The matters which we then discussed have suddenly
acquired fearful importance. This paper occasions us, on
your account, the profoundest anxiety." Mr. Aubrey continued
silent, gazing on Mr. Parkinson with intensity.</p>

<p>"Supposing, from a hasty glance at it, and from the message
accompanying it, that it was merely another action
of Tomkins's about the slip of waste land attached to
Jolter's cottage, I sent up to London to my agents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
Messrs. Runnington, requesting them to call on the plaintiff's
attorneys, and settle the action. He did so; and&mdash;perhaps
you will explain the rest," said Mr. Parkinson,
with visible trepidation, to Mr. Runnington.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said that gentleman, with a serious air, but
much more calmly and firmly than Mr. Parkinson had
spoken. "I called accordingly, early yesterday morning,
on Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap&mdash;they are a very
well&mdash;but not enviably&mdash;known firm in the profession;
and in a few minutes my misconception of the nature of
the business which I had called to arrange, was set right.
In short"&mdash;&mdash; he paused, as if distressed at the intelligence
which he was about to communicate.</p>

<p>"Oh, pray, pray go on, sir!" said Mr. Aubrey, in a
low tone.</p>

<p>"I am no stranger, sir, to your firmness of character;
but I shall have to tax it, I fear, to its uttermost. To
come at once to the point&mdash;they told me that I might
undoubtedly <i>settle</i> the matter, if you would consent to
give up immediate possession of <i>the whole Yatton estate</i>,
and account for the mesne profits to their client, the right
heir&mdash;as they contend&mdash;a Mr. Tittlebat Titmouse." Mr.
Aubrey leaned back in his chair, overcome, for an instant,
by this astounding intelligence; and all three of them
preserved silence for more than a minute. Mr. Runnington
was a man of a very feeling heart. In the course of
his great practice he had had to encounter many distressing
scenes; but probably none of them had equalled that
in which, at the earnest entreaty of Mr. Parkinson, who
distrusted his own self-possession, he now bore a leading
part. The two attorneys interchanged frequent looks of
deep sympathy for their unfortunate client, who seemed
as if stunned by the intelligence they had brought him.</p>

<p>"I felt it my duty to lose not an instant in coming
down to Yatton," resumed Mr. Runnington, observing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Mr. Aubrey's eye again directed inquiringly towards him;
"for Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap are very dangerous
people to deal with, and must be encountered
promptly, and with the greatest possible caution. The
moment that I had left them, I hastened to the Temple,
to retain for you Mr. Subtle, the leader of the Northern
Circuit; but they had been beforehand with me, and
retained him nearly three months ago, together with another
eminent king's counsel on the circuit. Under these
circumstances, I lost no time in giving a special retainer
to the Attorney-General, in which I trust I have done
right, and in retaining as junior a gentleman whom I consider
to be incomparably the ablest and most experienced
lawyer on the circuit."</p>

<p>"Did they say anything concerning the nature of their
client's title?" inquired Mr. Aubrey, after some expressions
of amazement and dismay.</p>

<p>"Very little&mdash;I might say, nothing. If they had been
<i>never</i> so precise, of course I should have distrusted every
word they said. They certainly mentioned that they had
had the first conveyancing opinions in the kingdom, which
concurred in favor of their client; that they had been for
months prepared at all points, and accident only had delayed
their commencing proceedings till now."</p>

<p>"Did you make any inquiries as to who the claimant
was?" inquired Mr. Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Yes; but all I could learn was, that they had discovered
him by mere accident; and that he was at present
in very obscure and distressed circumstances. I tried
to discover by what means they proposed to commence
and carry on so expensive a contest; but they smiled
significantly, and were silent." Another long pause ensued,
during which Mr. Aubrey was evidently silently
struggling with very agitating emotions.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of their affecting to seek the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
recovery of only one insignificant portion of the property?"
he inquired.</p>

<p>"It is their own choice&mdash;it may be from considerations
of mere convenience. The title, however, by which they
may succeed in obtaining what they at present go for,
will avail to recover every acre of the estate, and the
present action will consequently decide everything!"</p>

<p>"And suppose the worst&mdash;that they are successful,"
said Mr. Aubrey, after they had conversed a good deal,
and very anxiously, on the subject of a presumed infirmity
in Mr. Aubrey's title, which had been pointed out to him
in general terms by Mr. Parkinson, on the occasion already
adverted to&mdash;"what is to be said about the rental which
I have been receiving all this time&mdash;ten thousand a-year?"
inquired Mr. Aubrey, looking as if he dreaded to
hear his question answered.</p>

<p>"Oh! that's quite an after consideration&mdash;let us first
fight the battle," said Mr. Runnington.</p>

<p>"I beg, sir, that you will withhold nothing from me,"
said Mr. Aubrey. "To what extent shall I be liable?"</p>

<p>Mr. Runnington paused.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that <i>all</i> the mesne profits, as they
are called, which you have received"&mdash;commenced Mr. Parkinson&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, no," interrupted Mr. Runnington; "I have been
turning that matter over in my mind, and I think that
the statute of limitations will bar all but the last six years"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, <i>that</i> will be sixty thousand pounds!" interrupted
Mr. Aubrey, with a look of sudden despair.
"Gracious Heavens, that is perfectly frightful!&mdash;frightful!
If I lose Yatton, I shall not have a place to put my
head in&mdash;not one farthing to support myself with! And
yet to have to make up <i>sixty thousand pounds</i>!" The
perspiration bedewed his forehead, and his eye was laden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
with alarm and agony. He slowly rose from his chair
and bolted the door, that they might not, at such an agitating
moment, be surprised or disturbed by any of the
servants or the family.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said he, in a faint and tremulous tone,
"that if this claim succeed, my mother also will share
my fate"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>They shook their heads in silence.</p>

<p>"Permit me to suggest," said Mr. Runnington, in a
tone of the most respectful sympathy, "that sufficient for
the day is the evil thereof."</p>

<p>"But the <span class="smcap">night</span> follows!" said Mr. Aubrey, with a
visible tremor; and his voice made the hearts of his companions
thrill within them. "I have a fearful misgiving
as to the issue of these proceedings! I ought not to
have neglected the matter pointed out to me by Mr.
Parkinson on my marriage! I feel as if I had been culpably
lying by ever since!&mdash;But I really did not attach
to it the importance it deserved: I never, indeed, distinctly
appreciated the nature of what was then mentioned to me!"</p>

<p>"A thousand pities that a <i>fine</i> was not <i>levied</i>, is it
not?" said Mr. Runnington, turning with a sigh to Mr. Parkinson.</p>

<p>"Ay, indeed it is!" replied that gentleman&mdash;and they
spoke together for some time, and very earnestly, concerning
the nature and efficacy of such a measure, which they
explained to Mr. Aubrey.</p>

<p>"It comes to this," said he, "that in all probability, I
and my family are at this moment"&mdash;he shuddered&mdash;"trespassers
at Yatton!"</p>

<p>"That, Mr. Aubrey," said Mr. Parkinson, earnestly, "remains
to be proved! We really are getting on far too fast.
A person who heard us might suppose that the jury had
already returned a verdict against us&mdash;that judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
had been signed&mdash;and that the sheriff was coming in the
morning to execute the writ of possession in favor of our
opponent." This was well meant by the speaker; but
surely it was like talking of the machinery of the ghastly
guillotine to the wretch in shivering expectation of suffering
by it on the morrow. An involuntary shudder ran
through Mr. Aubrey. "Sixty thousand pounds!" he exclaimed,
rising and walking to and fro. "Why, I am
ruined beyond all redemption! How can I ever satisfy
it?" Again he paced the room several times, in silent
agony. Presently he resumed his seat. "I have, for
these several days past, had a strange sense of impending
calamity," said he, more calmly&mdash;"I have been equally
unable to account for, or get rid of it. It may be an intimation
from Heaven; I bow to its will!"</p>

<p>"We must remember," said Mr. Runnington, "that
'<i>possession is nine-tenths of the law</i>;' which means, that
your mere possession will entitle you to retain it against
all the world, till a stronger title than yours to the right
of possession be made out. You stand on a mountain;
and it is for your adversary to displace you, not by showing
merely that you have no real title, but that <i>he has</i>.
If he could prove all your title-deeds to be merely waste
paper&mdash;that in fact you have no more title to Yatton
than I have&mdash;he would not, if he were to stop there, have
advanced his own case an inch; he must <i>first</i> establish in
himself a clear and independent title; so that you are
entirely on the defensive; and rely upon it, that though
never so many screws may be loose, so acute and profound
a lawyer as the Attorney-General will impose every difficulty
on our opponents"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nay, but God forbid that any unconscientious advantage
should be taken on my behalf!" said Mr. Aubrey.
Mr. Runnington and Mr. Parkinson both opened their
eyes pretty wide at this sally; the latter could not at first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
understand why <i>everything</i> should not be fair in war; the
former saw and appreciated the nobility of soul which had
dictated the exclamation.</p>

<p>"I suppose the affair will soon become public," said Mr.
Aubrey, with an air of profound depression, after much
further conversation.</p>

<p>"Your position in the county, your eminence in public
life, the singularity of the case, and the magnitude of the
stake&mdash;all are circumstances undoubtedly calculated soon
to urge the affair before the notice of the public," said Mr. Runnington.</p>

<p>"What disastrous intelligence to break to my family!"
exclaimed Mr. Aubrey, tremulously. "With what fearful
suddenness it has burst upon us! But something, I suppose,"
he presently added with forced calmness, "must be
done immediately?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," replied Mr. Runnington. "Mr. Parkinson
and I will immediately proceed to examine your
title-deeds, the greater portion of which are, I understand,
here in the Hall, and the rest at Mr. Parkinson's; and
prepare, without delay, a case for the opinion of the Attorney-General,
and also of the most eminent conveyancers
of the kingdom. Who, by the way," said Mr. Runnington,
addressing Mr. Parkinson&mdash;"who was the conveyancer
that had the abstracts before him, on preparing Mr. Aubrey's
marriage-settlement?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you are alluding to the '<i>Opinion</i>' I mentioned to
you this evening?" inquired Mr. Parkinson. "I have it
at my house, and will show it you in the morning. The
doubt he expressed on one or two points gave me, I recollect,
no little uneasiness&mdash;as <i>you</i> may remember, Mr. Aubrey."</p>

<p>"I certainly do," he replied with a profound sigh;
"but though what you said reminded me of something
or other that I had heard when a mere boy, I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
no more of it. I think you also told me that the gentleman
who wrote the opinion was a nervous, fidgety man,
always raising difficulties in his clients' titles&mdash;and one
way or another, the thing never gave me any concern&mdash;scarcely
ever even occurred to my thoughts, till to-day!
What infatuation has been mine!&mdash;But you will take a
little refreshment, gentlemen, after your journey?" said
Mr. Aubrey, suddenly, glad of the opportunity it would
afford him of reviving his own exhausted spirits by a
little wine, before returning to the drawing-room. He
swallowed several glasses of wine without their producing
any immediately perceptible effect; and the bearers of
the direful intelligence just communicated to the reader,
after a promise by Mr. Aubrey to drive over to Grilston
early in the morning, and bring with him such of his title-deeds
as were then at the Hall, took their departure;
leaving him outwardly calmer, but with a fearful oppression
at his heart. He made a powerful effort to control
his feelings, so as to conceal, for a while at least, the dreadful
occurrence of the evening. His countenance and constrained
manner, however; on re-entering the drawing-room,
which his mother, attended by Kate, had quitted
for her bedroom&mdash;somewhat alarmed Mrs. Aubrey; but
he easily quieted her&mdash;poor soul!&mdash;by saying that he
certainly <i>had</i> been annoyed&mdash;"excessively annoyed"&mdash;at
a communication just made to him; "and which might,
in fact, prevent his sitting again for Yatton." "Oh, <i>that's</i>
the cause of your long stay? There, Doctor, am I not
right?" said Mrs. Aubrey, appealing to Dr. Tatham.
"Did I not tell you that this was something connected
with politics? Oh, dearest Charles&mdash;I do <i>hate</i> politics!
Give <i>me</i> a quiet home!" A pang shot through Mr. Aubrey's
heart; but he felt that he had, for the present,
succeeded in his object.</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey's distracted mind was indeed, as it were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
buffeted about that night on a dark sea of trouble; while
the beloved being beside him lay sleeping peacefully, all
unconscious of the rising storm! Many times, during
that dismal night, would he have risen from his bed to
seek a momentary relief by walking to and fro, but that
he feared disturbing her, and disclosing the extent and
depth of his distress. It was nearly five o'clock in the
morning before he at length sank into sleep; and of one
thing I can assure the reader, that however that excellent
man might have shrunk&mdash;and shrink he did&mdash;from the
sufferings which seemed in store, not for himself only, but
for those who were far dearer to him than life itself, he
did not give way to one repining or rebellious thought.
On the contrary, his real frame of mind, on that trying
occasion, may be discovered in one short prayer, which
his agonized soul was more than once on the point of expressing
aloud in words&mdash;"Oh, my God! in my prosperity
I have endeavored always to acknowledge thee;
forsake not me and mine in our adversity!"</p>

<p>At an early hour in the morning Mr. Aubrey's carriage
drew up at Mr. Parkinson's door; and he brought with
him, as he had promised, a great number of title-deeds
and family documents. On these, as well as on many
others which were in Mr. Parkinson's custody, that gentleman
and Mr. Runnington were anxiously engaged during
almost every minute of that day and the ensuing one;
at the close of which, they had between them drawn up
the rough draft of a case, with which Mr. Runnington set
off for town by the mail; undertaking to lay it immediately
before the Attorney-General, and also before one or
two of the most eminent conveyancers of the day, effectually
commended to their best and earliest attention. He
pledged himself to transmit their opinions, by the very
first mail, to Mr. Parkinson; and both of those gentlemen
immediately set about active preparations for defending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
the ejectment. The "eminent conveyancer" fixed upon
by Messrs. Runnington and Parkinson was Mr. Tresayle,
whose clerk, however, on looking into the papers, presently
carried them back to Messrs. Runnington, with the
startling information that Mr. Tresayle had, a few months
before, "advised on the other side!" The next person
whom Mr. Runnington thought of, was&mdash;singularly
enough&mdash;Mr. Mortmain, who, on account of his eminence,
was occasionally employed, in heavy matters, by the firm.
<i>His</i> clerk, also, on the ensuing morning returned the papers,
assigning a similar reason to that which had been
given by Mr. Tresayle's clerk! All this formed a direful
corroboration, truly, of Messrs. Quirk and Gammon's assurance
to Mr. Runnington, that they had "had the first
conveyancing opinions in the kingdom;" and evidenced
the formidable scale on which their operations were being
conducted. There were, however, other "eminent conveyancers"
besides the two above mentioned; and in the
hands of Mr. Mansfield, who, with a less extended reputation,
but an equal practice, was a far abler man, and a
much higher style of conveyancer, than Mr. Mortmain,
Mr. Runnington left his client's interests with the utmost
confidence. Not satisfied with this, he laid the case also
before Mr. Crystal, the junior whom he had already retained
in the cause&mdash;a man whose lucid understanding
was not ill indicated by his name. Though his manner
in court was not particularly forcible or attractive, he was
an invaluable acquisition in an important cause. To law
he had for some twenty years applied himself with unwearying
energy; and he consequently became a ready,
accurate, and thorough lawyer, equal to all the practical
exigencies of his profession. He brought his knowledge
to bear on every point presented to him, with beautiful
precision. He was equally quick and cautious&mdash;artful
to a degree&mdash;But I shall have other opportunities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
describing him; since on him, as on every working junior,
will devolve the real conduct of the defendant's case
in the memorable action of <i>Doe on the demise of Titmouse</i>
v. <i>Roe</i>.</p>

<p>As Mr. Aubrey was driving home from the visit to Mr.
Parkinson, which I have just above mentioned, he stopped
his carriage and alighted, on entering the village, because
he saw Dr. Tatham coming out of Williams's cottage, where
he had been paying a visit to poor dying Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>The little doctor was plunthering on, ankle-deep in
snow, towards the vicarage, when Mr. Aubrey (who had
sent home his carriage with word that he should presently
follow) came up with him, and greeting him with
unusual fervor, said that he would accompany him to the vicarage.</p>

<p>"You are in very great trouble, my dear friend," said
the doctor, seriously&mdash;"I saw it plainly last night;
but of course I said nothing. Come in with me! Let
us talk freely with one another; for, <i>as iron sharpeneth
iron, so doth the countenance of a man his friend</i>. Is it
not so?"</p>

<p>"It is indeed, my dear doctor," replied Mr. Aubrey, suddenly
softened by the affectionate simplicity of the doctor's
manner. How much the good doctor was shocked
by the communication which Mr. Aubrey presently made
to him, the reader may easily imagine. He even shed
tears, on beholding the forced calmness with which Mr.
Aubrey depicted the gloomy prospect that was before
him. The venerable pastor led the subdued mind of his
companion to those sources of consolation and support
which a true Christian cannot approach in vain. Upon
his bruised and bleeding feelings were poured the balm
of true religious consolation; and Mr. Aubrey quitted his
revered companion with a far firmer tone of mind than
that with which he had entered the vicarage. But as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
soon as he had passed through the park gates, the sudden
reflection that he was probably no longer the proprietor
of the dear old familiar objects that met his eye at
every step, almost overpowered him, and he walked several
times up and down the avenue, before he had recovered
a due degree of self-possession.</p>

<p>On entering the Hall, he was informed that one of the
tenants, Peter Johnson, had been sitting in the servants'
hall for nearly two hours, waiting to see him. Mr. Aubrey
repaired at once to the library, and desired the man
to be shown in. This Johnson had been for some twenty-five
years a tenant of a considerable farm on the estate;
had scarcely ever been behind-hand with his rent; and
had always been considered one of the most exemplary
persons in the whole neighborhood. He had now, poor
fellow, got into trouble indeed: for he had, a year or two
before, been persuaded to become security for his brother-in-law,
a tax-collector; and had, alas! the day before, been
called upon to pay the three hundred pounds in which
he stood bound&mdash;his worthless brother-in-law having absconded
with nearly £1,000 of the public money. Poor
Johnson, who had a large family to support, was in deep
tribulation, bowed down with grief and shame; and after
a sleepless night, had at length ventured down to Yatton,
with a desperate boldness, to ask its benevolent owner to
advance him £200 towards the money, to save himself
from being cast into prison. Mr. Aubrey heard this sad
story to the end, without one single interruption; though
to a more practised observer than the troubled old farmer,
the workings of Mr. Aubrey's countenance, from time to
time, must have told his inward agitation. "I lend this
poor soul £200!" thought he, "who am penniless myself!
Shall I not be really acting as <i>his</i> dishonest relative
has been acting, and making free with money which
belongs to another?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>"I assure you, my worthy friend," said he at length,
with a little agitation of manner, "that I have just now
a very serious call upon me&mdash;or you know how gladly I
would have complied with your request."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, have mercy on me! I've an ailing wife and
seven children to support," said poor Johnson, wringing
his hands.</p>

<p>"Can't I do anything with the Government?"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, sir; I'm told they're so mighty angry with my
rascally brother, they'll listen to nobody! It's a hard
matter for me to keep things straight at home without
this, sir, I've so many mouths to fill; and if they take
me off to prison, Lord! Lord! what's to become of us all?"</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey's lip quivered. Johnson fell on his knees,
and the tears ran down his cheeks. "I've never asked
a living man for money before, sir; and if you'll only lend
it me, God Almighty will bless you and yours; you'll save
us all from ruin; I'll work day and night to pay it back again!"</p>

<p>"Rise&mdash;rise, Johnson," said Mr. Aubrey, with emotion.
"You shall have the money, my friend, if you
will call to-morrow," he added with a deep sigh, after a
moment's hesitation.</p>

<p>He was as good as his word.[<a href='#Note_19'>19</a>]</p>

<p>Had Mr. Aubrey been naturally of a cheerful and vivacious
turn, the contrast now afforded by his gloomy manner
must have alarmed his family. As it was, however,
the contrast was not so strong and marked as to be attended
with that effect, especially as he exerted himself
to the utmost to conceal his distress. That <i>something</i>
had gone wrong, he freely acknowledged; and as he
spoke of it always in connection with political topics, he
succeeded in parrying their questions, and checking suspicion.
But, whenever they were all collected together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
could he not justly compare them to a happy group, unconscious
that they stood on a mine which was on the eve
of being fired?</p>

<p>About a week afterwards, namely, on the 12th of January,
arrived little Charles's birthday, when he became
five years old; and Kate had for some days been moving
heaven and earth to get up a juvenile ball in honor of the
occasion. After divers urgent despatches, and considerable
riding and driving about, she succeeded in persuading
the parents of some eight or ten children&mdash;two little
daughters, for instance, of the Earl of Oldacre (beautiful
creatures they were, to be sure)&mdash;little Master and the
two Miss Bertons, the children of one of the county members&mdash;Sir
Harry Oldfield, an orphan of about five years
of age, the infant owner of a magnificent estate&mdash;and
two or three little girls beside&mdash;to send them all&mdash;cold
as was the weather&mdash;to Yatton, for a day and a night,
with their governesses and attendants.</p>

<p>'Twas a charming little affair! It went off brilliantly,
as the phrase is, and repaid all Kate's exertions. She,
her mother, and brother, and sister, all dined at the same
table, at a very early hour, with the merry little guests,
who, (with a laughable crowd of attendants behind them,
to be sure) behaved remarkably well on the occasion. Sir
Harry (a little thing about Charles's age&mdash;the black ribbon
round his waist, and also the half-mourning dress
worn by his maid, who stood behind him, showed how
recent was the event which had made him an orphan)
proposed little Aubrey's health, in (I must own) a somewhat
stiff speech, demurely dictated to him by Kate, who
sat between him and her beautiful little nephew. She
then performed the same office for Charles, who stood on
a chair while delivering his eloquent acknowledgment of
the toast.</p>

<p>[Oh! that anguished brow of thine, Aubrey, (thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
God it is unobserved!) but it tells <i>me</i> that the iron is
entering thy soul!]</p>

<p>And the moment that he had done&mdash;Kate folding her
arms around him and kissing him&mdash;down they all jumped,
and, a merry throng, scampered off to the drawing-room,
(followed by Kate,) where blind-man's buff, husbands and
wives, and divers other little games, kept them in constant
enjoyment. After tea, they were to have dancing&mdash;Kate
mistress of the ceremonies&mdash;and it was quite
laughable to see how perpetually she was foiled in her efforts
to form the little sets. The girls were orderly enough&mdash;but
their wild little partners were quite uncontrollable!
The instant they were placed, and Kate had gone
to the instrument and struck off a bar or two&mdash;ah!&mdash;what
a scrambling little crowd was to be seen wildly jumping
and laughing, and chattering and singing! Over and
over again she formed them into sets, with the like results.
But at length a young lady, one of their governesses,
took Miss Aubrey's place at the piano, leaving the
latter to superintend the performances in person. She at
length succeeded in getting up something like a country-dance,
led off by Charles and little Lady Anne Cherville,
the eldest daughter of the Earl of Oldacre, a beautiful
child of about five years old, and who, judging from appearances,
bade fair in due time to become another Lady
Caroline Caversham. You would have laughed outright
to watch the coquettish airs which this little creature
gave herself with Charles, whom yet she evidently could
not bear to see dancing with another.</p>

<p>"Now <i>I</i> shall dance with somebody else!" he exclaimed,
suddenly quitting Lady Anne, and snatching
hold of a sweet little thing, Miss Berton, standing modestly
beside him. The discarded beauty walked with a
stately air, and a swelling heart, towards Mrs. Aubrey,
who sat beside her husband on the sofa; and on reaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
her, stood for a few moments silently watching her fickle
partner busily and gayly engaged with her successor&mdash;Then
she burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Charles!" called out Mrs. Aubrey; who had watched
the whole affair, and could hardly keep her countenance&mdash;"come
hither directly, Charles!"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma!" he exclaimed&mdash;quite unaware of the
serious aspect which things were assuming&mdash;and without
quitting the dance, where he was (as his jealous mistress
too plainly saw, for, despite her grief, her eye seemed to
follow all his motions) skipping about with infinite glee
with a <i>third</i> partner&mdash;a laughing sister of her for whom
he had quitted Lady Anne.</p>

<p>"Do you hear your mamma, Charles!" said Mr.
Aubrey, somewhat peremptorily; and in an instant his
little son, all flushed and breathless, was at his side.</p>

<p>"Well, dear papa!" said he, keeping his eye fixed on
the merry throng he had just quitted, and where his
deserted partner was skipping about alone.</p>

<p>"What have you been doing to Lady Anne, Charles?"
said his father.</p>

<p>"Nothing, dear papa!" he replied, still wistfully
eying the dancers.</p>

<p>"You know you left me, and went to dance with Miss
Berton; you did, Charles!" said the offended beauty,
sobbing.</p>

<p>"That is not behaving like a little gentleman, Charles,"
said his father. The tears came to the child's eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm <i>very</i> sorry, dear papa, I <i>will</i> dance with her."</p>

<p>"No, not now," said Lady Anne, haughtily.</p>

<p>"Oh, pooh! pooh!&mdash;kiss and be friends," said Mrs.
Aubrey, laughing, "and go and dance as prettily as you
were doing before." Little Aubrey put his arms around
Lady Anne, kissed her, and away they both started to the
dance again. While the latter part of this scene was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
going on, Mr. Aubrey's eye caught the figure of a servant
who simply made his appearance at the door and then
retired, (for such had been Mr. Aubrey's orders, in the
event of any messenger arriving from Grilston.) Hastily
whispering that he should speedily return, he left the
room. In the hall stood a clerk from Mr. Parkinson;
and on seeing Mr. Aubrey, he took out a packet and
retired&mdash;Mr. Aubrey, with evident trepidation, repairing
to his library. With a nervous hand he broke the
seal, and found the following letter from Mr. Parkinson,
with three other enclosures:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class='sigr' style='margin-left:1em;'>"<i>Grilston, 12th Jan. 18&mdash;.</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"I have only just received, and at once forward to you,
copies of the three opinions given by the Attorney-General,
Mr. Mansfield, and Mr. Crystal. I lament to find that they
are all of a discouraging character. They were given by their
respective writers without any of them having had any opportunity
of conferring together&mdash;all the three cases having been
laid before them at the same time: yet you will observe that
each of them has hit upon precisely the same point, viz. that
the descendants of Geoffrey Dreddlington had no right to succeed
to the inheritance till there was a failure of the heirs of
Stephen Dreddlington. If, therefore, our discreditable opponents
should have unhappily contrived to ferret out some person
satisfying that designation, (I cannot conjecture how they
can ever have got upon the scent,) I really fear (it is no use
disguising matters) we must prepare for a very serious struggle.
I have been quietly pushing my inquiries in all directions,
with a view to obtaining a clew to the case intended to be set
up against us, and which you will find very shrewdly guessed
at by the Attorney-General. <i>Nor am I the only party</i>, I find,
in the field, who has been making pointed inquiries in your
neighborhood; but of this more when we meet to-morrow.</p>

<p class='sigc'>"I remain,</p>
<p class='sigr' style='margin-right:4em'>"Yours most respectfully,</p>
<p class='sigr' style='margin-right:0em'>"<span class="smcap">J. Parkinson</span>.</p>
<p class='sigl'>"<span class="smcap">Charles Aubrey, Esq.</span>, M. P. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c."</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>Having read this letter, Mr. Aubrey sank back in his
chair, and remained motionless for more than a quarter
of an hour. At length he roused himself, and read over
the opinions; the effect of which&mdash;as far as he could
comprehend their technicalities&mdash;he found had been but
too correctly given by Mr. Parkinson. Some suggestions
and inquiries put by the acute and experienced Mr. Crystal,
suddenly revived recollections of one or two incidents
even of his boyish days, long forgotten, but which, as he
reflected upon them, began to reappear to his mind's eye
with sickening distinctness. Wave after wave of apprehension
and agony passed over him, chilling and benumbing
his heart within him; so that, when his little son
came some time afterwards running up to him, with a
message from his mamma, that she hoped he could come
back to see them all play at snap-dragon before they
went to bed, he replied mechanically, hardly seeming sensible
even of the presence of the laughing and breathless
boy, who quickly scampered back again. At length, with
a groan that came from the depths of his heart, Mr.
Aubrey rose and walked to and fro, sensible of the necessity
of exertion, and preparing himself, in some degree,
for encountering his mother, his wife, and his sister.
Taking up his candle, he hastened to his dressing-room,
where he hoped, by the aid of refreshing ablutions, to
succeed in effacing at least the stronger of those traces
of suffering which his glass displayed to him, as it reflected
the image of his agitated countenance. A sudden
recollection of the critical and delicate situation of his
idolized wife, glanced through his heart like a keen arrow.
He sank upon the sofa, and, clasping his hands, looked
indeed forlorn. Presently the door was pushed hastily
but gently open; and, first looking in to see that it was
really he of whom she was in search, in rushed Mrs.
Aubrey, pale and agitated, having been alarmed by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
long-continued absence from the drawing-room, and the
look of the servant, from whom she had learned that his
master had been for some time gone up-stairs.</p>

<p>"Charles! my love! my sweet love!" she exclaimed,
rushing in, sitting down beside him, and casting her arms
round his neck. Overcome by the suddenness of her
appearance and movements, for a moment he spoke not.</p>

<p>"For mercy's sake&mdash;as you love me!&mdash;tell me,
dearest Charles, what has happened!" she gasped, kissing
him fervently.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;love&mdash;nothing," he replied; but his look
belied his speech.</p>

<p>"Oh! am not I your wife, dearest? Charles, I shall
really go distracted if you do not tell me what has happened!&mdash;I
know that something&mdash;something dreadful"&mdash;He
put his arm round her waist, and drew her tenderly
towards him. He felt her heart beating violently. He
kissed her cold forehead, but spoke not.</p>

<p>"Come, dearest!&mdash;my own Charles!&mdash;let me share
your sorrows," said she, in a thrilling voice. "Cannot
you trust your Agnes? Has not Heaven <i>sent</i> me to share
your anxieties and griefs?"</p>

<p>"I love you, Agnes! ay, perhaps more than ever man
loved woman!" he faltered, as he felt her arms folding
him in closer and closer embrace; and she gazed at him
with wild agitation, expecting presently to hear of some
fearful catastrophe.</p>

<p>"I cannot bear this much longer, dearest&mdash;I feel I
cannot," said she, rather faintly. "<i>What</i> has happened?
What, that you dare not tell <i>me</i>? I can bear anything,
while I have you and my children! You have been unhappy&mdash;you
have been wretched, Charles, for many days
past. I have felt that you were!&mdash;I will not part with
you till I know all!"</p>

<p>"You soon <i>must</i> know all, my sweet love; and I take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
Heaven to witness, that it is principally on your account,
and that of my children, that I&mdash;&mdash; in fact, I did not
wish any of you to have known it till"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You&mdash;are never going&mdash;<i>to fight a duel</i>?" she gasped,
turning white as death.</p>

<p>"Oh! no, no, Agnes! I solemnly assure you! If I could
have brought myself to engage in such an unhallowed
affair, would <i>this</i> scene ever first have occurred? No, no,
my own love! Must I then tell you of the misfortune
that has overtaken us?" His words somewhat restored
her, but she continued to gaze at him in mute and breathless
apprehension. "Let me then conceal nothing, Agnes&mdash;they
are bringing an action against me, which, if successful,
may cause us all to quit Yatton&mdash;and it may
be, forever."</p>

<p>"Oh, Charles!" she murmured, her eyes riveted upon
his, while she unconsciously moved still nearer to him and
trembled. Her head drooped upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Why is this?" she whispered, after a pause.</p>

<p>"Let us, dearest, talk of it another time. I have now
told you what you asked me."&mdash;He poured her out
a glass of water. Having drank a little, she appeared revived.</p>

<p>"Is all lost?&mdash;And&mdash;<i>why</i>? Do, my own Charles&mdash;let
me know really the worst!"</p>

<p>"We are young, my Agnes! and have the world before
us! Health and integrity are better than riches! You
and our little loves&mdash;<i>the children which God has given us</i>&mdash;are
<i>my</i> riches," said he, gazing at her with unspeakable
tenderness. "Even should it be the will of Heaven that
this affair should go against us&mdash;so long as they cannot
separate us from each other, they cannot <i>really</i> hurt us!"
She suddenly kissed him with frantic energy, and an
hysteric smile gleamed over her pallid excited features.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, Agnes!&mdash;calm yourself, for my sake!&mdash;as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
you love me!" His voice quivered. "Oh, how
very weak and foolish I have been to yield to"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" she gasped, evidently laboring with
hysteric oppression. "Hush!" said she, suddenly starting,
and wildly leaning forward towards the door which
opened into the gallery leading to the various bedrooms.
He listened&mdash;the <span class="smcap">mother'S</span> ear had been quick and true.
He presently heard the sound of many children's voices
approaching: they were the little party, accompanied
by Kate, and their attendants, on their way to bed;
and little Charles's voice was loudest, and his laugh the
merriest, of them all. A dreadful smile gleamed on Mrs.
Aubrey's face; her hand grasped her husband's with convulsive
pressure; and she suddenly sank, rigid and senseless,
upon the sofa. He seemed for a moment stunned at
the sight of her motionless figure. Soon, however, recovering
his presence of mind, he rang the bell, and one
or two female attendants quickly appeared, by whose joint
assistance Mrs. Aubrey was carried to her bed in the adjoining
room, where, by the use of the ordinary remedies,
she was, after a brief interval, restored to consciousness.
Her first languid look was towards Mr. Aubrey, whose
hand she slowly raised to her lips. She tried to throw
a smile over her wan features&mdash;but 't&nbsp;was in vain; and,
after a few heavy and half-choking sobs, her overcharged
feelings found relief in a flood of tears. Full of the liveliest
apprehensions as to the effect of this violent emotion
upon her, in her critical condition, he remained with her
for some time, pouring into her ear every soothing and
tender expression he could think of. He at length succeeded
in bringing her into a somewhat more tranquil
state than he could have expected. He strictly enjoined
the attendants, who had not quitted their lady's chamber,
and whose alarmed and inquisitive looks he had noticed
for some time with anxiety, to preserve silence concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
what they had so unexpectedly witnessed, adding, that
something unfortunate had happened, of which they would
hear but too soon.</p>

<p>"Are you going to tell Kate?" whispered Mrs. Aubrey,
sorrowfully. "Surely, love, <i>you</i> have suffered enough
through <i>my</i> weakness. Wait till to-morrow. Let her&mdash;poor
girl!&mdash;have a <i>few</i> more happy hours!"</p>

<p>"No, Agnes&mdash;it was my own weakness which caused
me to be surprised into this premature disclosure to you.
And now I <i>must</i> meet her again to-night, and I cannot
control either my features, or my feelings. Yes, poor
Kate, she must know all to-night! I shall not be long
absent, Agnes." And directing her maid to remain with
her till he returned, he withdrew, and with slow step and
heavy heart descended to the library; preparing himself
for another heart-breaking scene&mdash;plunging another innocent
and joyous creature into misery, which he believed
to be inevitable. Having looked into the drawing-room
as he passed it, and seen no one there&mdash;his mother having,
as usual, retired at a very early hour&mdash;he rang his
library bell, and desired Miss Aubrey's maid to request
her mistress to come down to him there, as soon as she
should be at leisure. He was glad that the only light in
the room was that given out by the fire, which was not
very bright, and so would in some degree shield his features
from, at all events, immediate scrutiny. His heart
ached as, shortly afterwards, he heard Kate's light step
crossing the hall. When she entered, her eyes sparkled
with vivacity, and a smile was on her beauteous cheek.
Her dress was slightly disordered, and her hair half uncurled&mdash;the
results of her sport with the little ones
whom she had been seeing to bed.</p>

<p>"What merry little things, to be sure!" she commenced
laughingly&mdash;"I could not get them to lie still a moment&mdash;popping
their little heads in and out of the clothes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
A fine time I shall have of it, by-and-by, with Sir Harry!
for he is to be <i>my</i> tiny little bed-fellow, and I dare say I
shall not sleep a wink all night!&mdash;Why, Charles, how
very&mdash;<i>very</i> grave you look!" she added, quickly observing
his eye fixed moodily upon her.</p>

<p>"'Tis you who are so very gay," he replied, endeavoring
to smile. "I want to speak to you, dear Kate," he
commenced affectionately&mdash;at the same time rising and
closing the door&mdash;"on a serious matter. I have received
some letters to-night"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Kate colored suddenly and violently, and her heart
beat; but, sweet soul! she was mistaken&mdash;very, very
far off the mark her troubled brother was aiming at.
"And, relying on your strength of mind, I have resolved
to put you at once in possession of what I myself know.
Can you bear bad news well, Kate?"</p>

<p>She turned very pale, and drawing her chair nearer to
her brother, said, "Do not keep me in suspense, Charles&mdash;I
can bear anything but suspense&mdash;that <i>is</i> dreadful!
What has happened? Oh dear," she added, with sudden
alarm, "where are mamma and Agnes?" She started to
her feet.</p>

<p>"I assure you they are both well, Kate. My mother
is now doubtless asleep, and as well as she ever was;
Agnes is in her bedroom&mdash;certainly much distressed
at the news which I am going"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh why, Charles, did you tell <i>anything</i> distressing to
<i>her</i>?" exclaimed Miss Aubrey, with an alarmed air.</p>

<p>"We came together by surprise, Kate! Perhaps, too,
it would have been worse to have kept her in suspense;
but she is recovering!&mdash;I shall soon return to her. And
now, my dear Kate&mdash;I know your strong sense and spirit&mdash;a
very great calamity hangs over us. Let you and
me," he grasped her hands affectionately, "stand it steadily,
and support those who cannot!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me at once know all, Charles. See if I do not
bear it as becomes your sister," said she, with forced calmness.</p>

<p>"If it should become necessary for all of us to retire
into obscurity&mdash;into humble obscurity, dear Kate&mdash;how
do you think you could bear it?"</p>

<p>"If it will be an honorable obscurity&mdash;nay, 'tis quite
impossible it can be a <i>dis</i>honorable obscurity," said Miss
Aubrey, with a momentary flash of energy.</p>

<p>"Never, never, Kate! The Aubreys may lose everything
on earth but the jewel <span class="smcap">honor</span>, and love for one another!"</p>

<p>"Let me know all, Charles: I see that something or
other shocking has happened," said Miss Aubrey, in a low
tone, with a look of the deepest apprehension.</p>

<p>"I will tell you the worst, Kate&mdash;- a strange claim is
set up&mdash;by one I never heard of&mdash;to the whole of the
property we now enjoy!"</p>

<p>Miss Aubrey started, and the slight color that remained
faded entirely from her cheek. Both were silent for very
nearly a minute.</p>

<p>"But is it a <i>true</i> claim, Charles?" she inquired, faintly.</p>

<p>"That remains to be proved. I will, however, disguise
nothing from you&mdash;I have woful apprehensions"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that Yatton <i>is not ours</i>?" inquired
Miss Aubrey, catching her breath.</p>

<p>"So, alas! my dearest Kate, it is said!"</p>

<p>Miss Aubrey looked bewildered, and pressed her hand
to her forehead.</p>

<p>"How shocking!&mdash;shocking!&mdash;shocking!" she
gasped&mdash;"What is to become of mamma?"</p>

<p>"God Almighty will not desert her in her old age. He
will desert none of us, if we only trust in him," said her brother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Aubrey remained gazing at him intently, and
continued perfectly motionless.</p>

<p>"Must we then all leave Yatton?" said she, faintly,
after a while.</p>

<p>"If this claim succeeds&mdash;but we shall leave it <i>together</i>, Kate."</p>

<p>She threw her arms around his neck, and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, Kate!" said he, perceiving the increasing
violence of her emotions, "restrain your feelings for
the sake of my mother&mdash;and Agnes."</p>

<p>His words had the desired effect: the poor girl made
a desperate effort. Unclasping her arms from her
brother's neck, she sat down in her chair, breathing hard,
and pressing her hand upon her heart. After a few
minutes' pause, she said faintly, "I am better now. Do
tell me more, Charles! Let me have something to <i>think</i>
about&mdash;only don't say anything about&mdash;about&mdash;mamma
and Agnes!" In spite of herself a visible shudder
ran through her frame.</p>

<p>"It seems, Kate," said he, with all the calmness he
could assume&mdash;"at least they are trying to prove&mdash;that
our branch of the family has succeeded to the property
prematurely&mdash;that there is living an heir of the
elder branch&mdash;that his case has been taken up by powerful
friends; and&mdash;let me tell you the worst at once&mdash;even
the lawyers consulted by Mr. Parkinson on my
behalf, take a most alarming view of the possibilities of
the case that may be brought against us"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"But is mamma provided for?" whispered Miss Aubrey,
almost inarticulately. "When I look at her again, I
shall drop at her feet insensible!"</p>

<p>"No, no, Kate, you won't! Heaven will give you
strength," said her brother, in a tremulous voice. "Remember,
my only sister&mdash;my dearest Kate! you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
support <i>me</i> in my trouble, as I will support you&mdash;we
will try to support each other"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"We will&mdash;we will!" interrupted Miss Aubrey&mdash;instantly
checking, however, her rising excitement.</p>

<p>"You bear it bravely, my noble girl!" said Mr. Aubrey,
fondly, after a brief interval of silence.</p>

<p>She turned from him her head, and moved her hand&mdash;in
deprecation of expressions which might utterly unnerve
her. Then she convulsively clasped her hands
over her forehead; and, after a minute or two, turned
towards him with tears in her eyes, but tranquillized
features. The struggle had been dreadful, though brief&mdash;her
noble spirit had recovered itself.</p>

<p>----'T was like some fair bark, in mortal conflict with
the black and boiling waters and howling hurricane;
long quivering on the brink of destruction, but at last
outliving the storm, righting itself, and suddenly gliding
into safe and tranquil waters!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The distressed brother and sister sat conversing for a
long time, frequently in tears, but with infinitely greater
calmness and firmness than could have been expected.
They agreed that Dr. Tatham should very early in the
morning be sent for, and implored to take upon himself
the bitter duty of breaking the matter as gradually and
safely as possible to Mrs. Aubrey; its effects upon whom,
her children anticipated with the most vivid apprehension.
They both considered that an event of such publicity
and importance could not possibly remain long
unknown to her, and that it was, on the whole, better
that the dreaded communication should be got over as
soon as possible. They then retired&mdash;Kate to a sleepless
pillow, and her brother to spend a greater portion of
the night in attempts to soothe and console his suffering
wife; each of them having first knelt in humble reverence,
and poured forth the breathings of a stricken and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
bleeding heart, before Him who hath declared that he is
ever present to <span class="smcap">hear</span> and to <span class="smcap">answer</span> prayer.</p>

<p>Ah! who can tell what a day or an hour may bring forth?</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"It won't kindle&mdash;not a bit on't&mdash;it's green and full
o' sap. Go out, and get us a log that's dry and old,
George&mdash;and let's try to have a bit of a blaze in t'ould
chimney, this bitter night," said Isaac Tonson, the gamekeeper
at Yatton, to the good-natured landlord of the
Aubrey Arms, the little&mdash;and only&mdash;inn of the village.
The suggestion was instantly attended to.</p>

<p>"How Peter's a-feathering of his geese to-night, to be
sure!" exclaimed the landlord on his return, shaking the
snow off his coat, and laying on the fire a great dry old
log of wood, which seemed very acceptable to the hungry
flames, for they licked it cordially the moment it was
placed among them, and there was very soon given out a
cheerful blaze. 'T&nbsp;was a snug room. The brick floor was
covered with fresh sand; and on a few stools and benches,
with a table in the middle, on which stood a large can and
ale-glasses, with a plate of tobacco, sat some half-dozen
men, enjoying their pipe and glass. In the chimney corner
sat Thomas Dickons, the faithful under-bailiff of Mr.
Aubrey, a big broad-shouldered, middle-aged man, with a
hard-featured face and a phlegmatic air. In the opposite
corner sat the little grizzle-headed clerk and sexton, old
Hallelujah&mdash;(as he was called, but his real name was
Jonas Higgs.) Beside him sat Pumpkin, the gardener
at the Hall, a very frequent guest at the Aubrey Arms
o' nights&mdash;always attended by Hector, the large Newfoundland
dog already spoken of, and who was now lying
stretched on the floor at Pumpkin's feet, his nose resting
on his fore feet, and his eyes, with great gravity, watching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
the motions of a skittish kitten under the table. Opposite
to him sat Tonson the gamekeeper&mdash;a thin, wiry, beetle-browed
fellow, with eyes like a ferret; and there were
also, one or two farmers, who lived in the village.</p>

<p>"Let's ha' another can o' ale, afore ye sit down," said
Tonson, "we can do with another half gallon, I'm thinking!"
This order also was quickly attended to; and then
the landlord, having seen to the door, fastened the shutters
close, and stirred the crackling fire, took his place on
a vacant stool, and resumed his pipe.</p>

<p>"So she do take a very long grave, Jonas?" inquired
Dickons of the sexton, after some little pause.</p>

<p>"Ay, Mr. Dickons, a' think she do, t'ould girl! I always
thought she would&mdash;I used to measure her (as one
may say) in my mind, whenever I saw her! 'Tis a reg'lar
<i>man's</i> size, I warrant you; and when parson saw it,
a' said, he thought 'twere too big; but I axed his pardon,
and said I hadn't been sexton for thirty years without
knowing my business&mdash;he, he!"</p>

<p>"I suppose, Jonas, you mun ha' seen her walking about
i' t'&nbsp;village, in your time!&mdash;<i>Were</i> she such a big-looking
woman?" inquired Pumpkin, as he shook the ashes out
of his pipe, and replenished it.</p>

<p>"Forty year ago I did use to see her&mdash;she were then
an old woman, wi' white hair, and leaned on a stick&mdash;I
never thought she'd a' lasted so long," replied Higgs,
emptying his glass.</p>

<p>"She've had a pretty long spell on't," quoth Dickons,
after slowly emptying his mouth of smoke.</p>

<p>"A hundred and two," replied the sexton; "so saith
her coffin-plate&mdash;a' see'd it to-day."</p>

<p>"What were her name?" inquired Tonson&mdash;"<i>I</i> never
knew her by any name but Blind Bess."</p>

<p>"Her name be <i>Elizabeth Crabtree</i> on the coffin," replied
Higgs; "and she be to be buried to-morrow."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>"She were a strange old woman," said Hazel, one of
the farmers, as he took down one of the oatcakes hanging
overhead; and breaking off a piece, held it with the tongs
before the fire to toast, and then put it into his ale.</p>

<p>"Ay, she were," quoth Pumpkin; "I wonder what she
thinks o' such things <i>now</i>&mdash;maybe&mdash;God forgive me!&mdash;she's
paying dear for her tricks!"</p>

<p>"Tut, Pumpkin," said Tonson, "let t'ould creature rest
in her grave, where she's going to, peaceably!"</p>

<p>"Ay, Master Tonson," quoth the clerk, in his reading-desk
twang&mdash;"<span class="smcap">There</span> <i>be no knowledge</i>, <i>nor wisdom</i>, <i>nor
device</i>!"</p>

<p>"'Tis very odd," observed Pumpkin, "but this dog that's
lying at my feet never could a' bear going past her cottage
late o' nights&mdash;hang me if he could; and the night
she died&mdash;Lord! you should have heard the howl Hector
gave&mdash;and a' didn't then know she were gone&mdash;it's as
true as the gospel&mdash;it <i>is</i>&mdash;actually!"</p>

<p>"No! but were't <i>really</i> so?" inquired Dickons&mdash;several
of the others taking their pipes out of their
mouths, and looking earnestly at Pumpkin.</p>

<p>"I didn't half like it, I can tell you," quoth Pumpkin.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!&mdash;ha, ha!" laughed the gamekeeper&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ay, marry, you may laugh," quoth Pumpkin, "but
I'll stake half-a-gallon o' ale you daren't go by yourself
to the cottage where she's lying&mdash;<i>now</i>, mind&mdash;i' the
dark."</p>

<p>"<i>I'll</i> do it," quoth Higgs, eagerly, preparing to lay
down his pipe.</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;<i>thou'rt</i> quite used to dead folk&mdash;'tis quite
in thy line!" replied Pumpkin&mdash;and, after a little faint
drollery, silence ensued for some moments.</p>

<p>"Bess dropped off sudden like, at the last, didn't
she?" inquired the landlord.</p>

<p>"She went out, as, they say, like the snuff of a candle,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
replied Jobbins, one of the farmers; "no one were with
her but my Missis at the time. The night afore, she
had took to the rattles all of a sudden. My Sall (that's
<i>done for</i> her, this long time, by Madam's orders,) says old
Bess were a good deal shaken by a chap from London,
which cam' down about a week afore Christmas."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," quoth one, "I've heard o' that&mdash;what was
it?&mdash;what passed atwixt them?"</p>

<p>"Why, a' don't well know&mdash;but he seemed to know
summat about t'ould girl's connections, and he had a book,
and wrote down something, and he axed her, so Sall do
tell me, such a many things about old people, and things
that are long gone by!"</p>

<p>"What were the use on't?" inquired Dickons; "for Bess
hath been silly this ten years, to my sartin knowledge."</p>

<p>"Why, a' couldn't tell. He seemed very 'quisitive,
too, about t'ould creature's Bible and prayer-book (she
kept them in that ould bag of hers)&mdash;and Sall said she
had talked a good deal to the chap in her mumbling way,
and seemed to know some folk he asked her about. And
Sall saith she hath been, in a manner, dismal ever since,
and often a-crying and talking to herself."</p>

<p>"I've heard," said the landlord, "that squire and parson
were wi' her on Christmas-day&mdash;and that she talked
a deal o' strange things, and that the squire did seem, as
it were, <i>struck</i> a little, you know&mdash;struck, like!"</p>

<p>"Why, so my Sall do say; but it may be all her own
head," replied Jobbins.</p>

<p>Here a pause took place.</p>

<p>"Madam," said the sexton, "hath given orders for an
uncommon decent burying to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Well, a' never thought any wrong of ould Bess, for
my part," said one&mdash;and another&mdash;and another; and
they smoked their pipes for some short time in silence.</p>

<p>"Talking o' strangers from London," said the sexton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
presently&mdash;"who do know anything o' them two chaps
that were at church last Sunday? Two such peacock
chaps I never see'd afore in <i>my</i> time&mdash;and grinning
all sarvice-time! the heathen!"</p>

<p>"Ay, I'll tell you something of 'em," said Hazel&mdash;a
big broad-shouldered farmer, who plucked his pipe out of
his mouth with sudden energy&mdash;"They're a brace o'
good ones, to be sure, ha, ha! Some week or ten days
ago, as I were a-coming across the field leading into the
lane behind the church, I see'd these same two chaps, and
on coming nearer, (they not seeing me for the hedge,)
Lord bless me! would you believe it?&mdash;if they wasn't
a-teasing my daughter Jenny, that were coming along wi'
some physic from the doctor for my old woman! One of
'em seemed a-going to put his arm round her neck and
t'&nbsp;other came close to her on t'&nbsp;other side, a-talking to her
and pushing her about." Here a young farmer, who had
but seldom spoken, took his pipe out of his mouth, and
exclaiming, "Lord bless me!" sat listening with his mouth
wide open. "Well," continued the former, "a' came into
the road behind 'em, without their seeing me; and"&mdash;(here
he stretched out a thick, rigid, muscular arm, and
clinched his teeth)&mdash;"a' got hold of each by the collar,
and one of 'em I shook about, and gave him a kick i' the
breech that sent him spinning a yard or two on the road,
he clapping his hand behind him, and crying, to be sure&mdash;'You'll
smart for this&mdash;a good hundred pound damages!'
or summat o' that sort. T'&nbsp;other dropped on his
knees, and begged for mercy; so a' just spit in his face,
and flung him under t'&nbsp;hedge, telling him if he stirred
till I were out o' sight, I'd crack his skull for him; and
so I would!" Here the wrathful speaker pushed his pipe
again between his lips, and began puffing away with great
energy; while he who had appeared to take so great an
interest in the story, and who was the very man who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
flown to the rescue of Miss Aubrey, when she seemed on
the point of being similarly treated, told that circumstance
exactly as it occurred, amid the silent but excited wonder
of those present&mdash;all of whom, at its close, uttered
vehement execrations, and intimated the summary and savage
punishment which the cowardly rascal would have experienced
at the hands of each and every one of them,
had they come across him.</p>

<p>"I reckon," said the landlord, as soon as the swell had
a little subsided, "they must be the two chaps that put
up here, some time ago, for an hour or so. You should
ha' seen 'em get on and off the saddle&mdash;that's all! Why,
a' laughed outright! The chap with the hair under his
chin got on upon the wrong side, and t'other seemed as if
he thought his beast would a' <i>bit</i> him!"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed all.</p>

<p>"I thought they'd a' both got a fall before they'd gone
a dozen yards!"</p>

<p>"They've taken a strange fancy to my churchyard,"
said the sexton, setting down his glass, and then preparing
to fill his pipe again; "they've been looking about among
'em&mdash;among t'ould gravestones, up behind t'ould yew-tree
yonder; and one of them writ something, now and
then, in a book; so they're book-writers, in coorse!"</p>

<p>"That's scholars, I reckon," quoth Dickons; "but rot
the larning of such chaps as them!"</p>

<p>"I wonder if they'll put a picture o' the Hall in
their book," quoth the sexton. "They axed a many
questions about the people up there, especially about the
squire's father, and some ould folk, whose names I knew
when they spoke of 'em&mdash;but I hadn't heard o' them for
this forty year. And one of 'em (he were the shortest,
and such a chap, to be sure!&mdash;just like the monkey that
were dressed i' man's clothes, last Grilston fair) talked
uncommon fine about young <i>Miss</i>"&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"If <i>I'd</i> a' heard him tak' her name into his dirty
mouth, his teeth should a' gone after it!" said Tonson.</p>

<p>"Lord! he didn't say any harm&mdash;only silly like&mdash;and
t'&nbsp;other seemed now and then not to like his going on
so. The little one said Miss were a lovely gal, or something
like that&mdash;and hoped they'd become by-and-by
better friends&mdash;ah, ha!"</p>

<p>"What! wi' that chap?" said Pumpkin&mdash;and he
looked as if he were meditating putting the little sexton
up the chimney, for the mere naming of such a thing.</p>

<p>"I reckon they're fro' London, and brought toon tricks
wi' 'em&mdash;for I never heard o' such goings on as theirs
down <i>here</i> afore," said Tonson.</p>

<p>"One of 'em&mdash;him that axed me all the questions,
and wrote i' t'&nbsp;book, seemed a sharp enough chap in his
way; but I can't say much for the little one," said
Higgs. "Lud, I couldn't hardly look in his face for
laughing, he seemed such a fool!&mdash;He had a riding-whip
wi' a silver head, and stood smacking his legs
(you should ha' seen how tight his clothes was on his
legs&mdash;I warrant you, Tim Timpkins never see'd such a
thing, I'll be sworn) all the while, as if a' liked to hear
the sound of it."</p>

<p>"If I'd a' been beside him," said Hazel, "I'd a' saved
him that trouble&mdash;only I'd a' laid it into <i>another</i> part
of him!"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" they laughed&mdash;and presently passed
on to other matters.</p>

<p>"Hath the squire been doing much lately in Parliament?"
inquired the sexton, of Dickons.</p>

<p>"Why, yes&mdash;he's trying hard to get that new road
made from Harkley bridge to Hilton."</p>

<p>"Ah, that would save a good four mile, if a' could manage
it!" said one of the farmers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hear the Papists are trying to get the upper hand
again&mdash;which the Lud forbid!" said the sexton, after
another pause.</p>

<p>"The squire hath lately made a speech in that matter,
that hath finished them," said Dickons, in a grave and
authoritative tone.</p>

<p>"What would they be after?" inquired the landlord
of Dickons, of whom, in common with all present, he
thought great things. "They <i>say</i> they wants nothing
but what's their own, and liberty, and that like"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"If thou wert a shepherd, Master Higgs," replied Dickons,
"and wert to be asked by ten or a dozen wolves to
let them in among thy flock of sheep, they saying how
quiet and kind they would be to 'em&mdash;would'st let
'em in, or keep 'em out?&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay&mdash;that be it&mdash;'tis as true as gospel!" said
the clerk.</p>

<p>"So you a'n't to have that old sycamore down, after
all, Master Dickons?" inquired Tonson, after a pause in
the conversation.</p>

<p>"No; Miss hath carried the day against the squire and
Mr. Waters; and there stands the old tree, and it hath
to be looked to better than ever it were afore!"</p>

<p>"Why hath Miss taken such a fancy to it? 'Tis an
old crazy thing!"</p>

<p>"If thou hadst been there when she did beg, as I may
say, its life," replied Dickons, with a little energy&mdash;"and
hadst seen her, and heard her voice, that be as smooth as
cream, thou would'st never have forgotten it, I can tell thee!"</p>

<p>"There isn't a more beautiful lady i' t'&nbsp;county, I reckon,
than the squire's sister?" inquired the sexton.</p>

<p>"No, nor in all England: if there be, I'll lay down
twenty pounds!"</p>

<p>"And where's to be found a young lady that do go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
about i' t'&nbsp;village like she?&mdash;She were wi' Ph&oelig;be Williams
t'other night, all through the snow, and i' t'&nbsp;dark."</p>

<p>"If I'd only laid hands on that chap!" interrupted
the young farmer, her rescuer.</p>

<p>"I wonder she do not choose some one to be married
to, up in London," said the landlord.</p>

<p>"She'll be having some delicate high quality chap, I
reckon, one o' these fine days," said Hazel.</p>

<p>"She will be a dainty dish, truly, for whomever God
gives her to," quoth Dickons.</p>

<p>"Ay, she will," said more than one, in an earnest tone.</p>

<p>"Now, to my mind," said Tonson, "saving your presence,
Master Dickons, I know not but young Madam be
more to my taste; she be in a manner somewhat fuller&mdash;plumper-like,
and her skin be <i>so</i> white, and her hair as
black as a raven's."</p>

<p>"There's not another two such women to be found
in the whole world," said Dickons, authoritatively. Here
Hector suddenly rose up, and went to the door, where he
stood snuffing in an inquisitive manner.</p>

<p>"Now, what do that dog hear, I wonder?" quoth
Pumpkin, curiously, stooping forward.</p>

<p>"Blind Bess," replied Tonson, winking his eye, and
laughing. Presently there was a sharp rapping at the
door; which the landlord opened, and let in one of the
servants from the Hall, his clothes white with snow, his
face nearly as white, with manifest agitation.</p>

<p>"Why, man, what's the matter?" inquired Dickons,
startled by the man's appearance. "Art frightened at anything?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord! oh, Lord!" he commenced.</p>

<p>"What is it, man? Art drunk?&mdash;or mad?&mdash;or frightened?
Take a drop o' drink," said Tonson. But the man
refused it.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!&mdash;There's woful work at the Hall!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the matter?" cried all at once, rising and
standing round the new-comer.</p>

<p>"If thou be'st drunk, John," said Dickons, sternly,
"there's a way of sobering thee&mdash;mind that."</p>

<p>"Oh, Master Dickons, I don't know what's come to
me, for grief and fright! The squire, they do say, and
all of us, are to be turned out o' Yatton!"</p>

<p>"<i>What!</i>" exclaimed all in a breath.</p>

<p>"There's some one else lays claim to it. We must all
go! Oh, Lud! oh, Lud!" No one spoke for a while;
and consternation was written on every face.</p>

<p>"Sit thee down here, John," said Dickons at length,
"and let us hear what thou hast to say&mdash;or thou wilt
have us all be going up in a body to the Hall."</p>

<p>Having forced on him part of a glass of ale, he began,&mdash;"There
hath been plainly mischief brewing, <i>somewhere</i>,
this many days, as I could tell by the troubled face o' t'
squire; but he kept it to himself. Lawyer Parkinson
and another have been latterly coming in chaises from
London; and last night the squire got a letter that seems
to have finished all. Such trouble there were last night
wi' t'&nbsp;squire, and young Madam and Miss! And to-day the
parson came, and were a long while alone with old Madam,
who hath since had a stroke, or a fit, or something of
that like, (the doctors have been there all day from Grilston,)
and likewise young Madam hath taken to her bed,
and is ill. Oh, Lud! oh, Lud! Such work there be
going on!"</p>

<p>"And what of the squire and Miss?" inquired some
one, after all had maintained a long silence.</p>

<p>"Oh, 't&nbsp;would break your heart to see them," said the
man, dolefully: "they be both pale as death: he so
dreadful sorrowful, but quiet, like, and she now and then
wringing her hands, and both of them going from the
bedroom of old Madam to young Madam's. Nay, an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
there had been half a dozen deaths i' t'&nbsp;house, it could
not be worse. Neither the squire or Miss hath touched
food the whole day!"</p>

<p>There was, in truth, not a dry eye in the room, nor
one whose voice did not seem somewhat obstructed with
his emotions.</p>

<p>"Who <i>told</i> thee all this about the squire's losing the
estate?" inquired Dickons, with mingled trepidation and sternness.</p>

<p>"We heard of it but an hour or so agone. Mr. Parkinson
(it seems by the squire's orders) told Mr. Waters,
and he told it to us; saying as how it was useless to
keep such a thing secret, and that we might as well all
know the occasion of so much trouble."</p>

<p>"Who's to ha' it then, instead of the squire?" at
length inquired Tonson, in a voice half choked with rage
and grief.</p>

<p>"Lord only knows at present. But whoever 'tis, there
isn't one of us sarvents but will go with the squire and
his&mdash;if it be even to prison, <i>that</i> I can tell ye!"</p>

<p>"I'm Squire <i>Aubrey's</i> gamekeeper," quoth Tonson,
his eye kindling as his countenance darkened, "and no
one's else! It shall go hard if any one else here hath a game"&mdash;</p>

<p>"But if there's law in the land, sure the justice must
be wi' t'&nbsp;squire&mdash;he and his family have had it so
long?" said one of the farmers.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, masters," said Pumpkin, mysteriously,
"I shall be somewhat better pleased when Jonas
here hath got that old creature Bess safe underground!"</p>

<p>"Blind Bess?" exclaimed Tonson, with a very serious,
not to say disturbed, countenance. "I wonder&mdash;sure!
sure! <i>that</i> ould witch can have had no hand in all this&mdash;&mdash; eh?"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Poor old soul, not she! There be no such things as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
witches now-a-days," exclaimed Jonas. "Not she, I warrant
me! She hath been ever befriended by the squire's
family. <i>She</i> do it!"</p>

<p>"The sooner we get that old woman underground, for
all that, the better, say I!" quoth Tonson, significantly.</p>

<p>"The parson hath a choice sermon on 'The Flying
away of Riches,'" said Higgs, in a quaint, sad manner;
"'tis to be hoped that he'll preach from it next Sunday!"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Soon after this, the little party dispersed, each oppressed
with greater grief and amazement than he had
ever known before. Bad news flies swiftly&mdash;and that
which had just come from the Hall, within a very few
hours of its having been told at the Aubrey Arms, had
spread grief and consternation among high and low for
many miles round Yatton.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p>Would you have believed it? Notwithstanding all that
had happened between Titmouse and Tag-rag, they positively
got reconciled to one another&mdash;a triumphant result
of the astute policy of Mr. Gammon. As soon as he had
heard Titmouse's infuriated account of his ignominious
expulsion from Satin Lodge, he burst into a fit of hearty
but gentle laughter, which at length subsided into an inward
chuckle which lasted the rest of the day; and was
occasioned, first, by gratification at the impression which
his own sagacity had evidently produced upon the powerful
mind of Titmouse; secondly, by an exquisite appreciation
of the mingled meanness and stupidity of Tag-rag.
I do not mean it to be understood, that Titmouse had
given Mr. Gammon such a terse and clear account of the
matter as I imagine myself to have given to the reader;
but still he told quite enough to put Mr. Gammon in full
possession of the true state of the case. Good: but then&mdash;instantly
reflected Gammon&mdash;what are we now to do
with Titmouse?&mdash;where was that troublesome little ape
to be caged, till it suited the purposes of his proprietors
(as Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap might surely be
called, for they had caught him, however they might fail
to tame him) to let him loose upon society, to amuse and
astonish it by his antics?&mdash;That was the question occupying
the thoughts of Mr. Gammon, while his calm, clear,
gray eye was fixed upon Titmouse, apparently very attentive
to what he was saying. That gentleman had
first told the story of his wrongs to Snap, who instantly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
rubbing his hands, suggested an indictment at the Clerkenwell
sessions&mdash;an idea which infinitely delighted Titmouse,
but was somewhat sternly "pooh-poohed!" by Mr.
Gammon as soon as he heard of it,&mdash;Snap thereat shrugging
his shoulders with a disconcerted air, but a bitter
sneer upon his sharp, hard face. Like many men of little
but active minds, early drilled to particular and petty
callings, Snap was equal to the mechanical conduct of
business&mdash;the mere working of the machinery&mdash;but, as
the phrase is, could never see an inch beyond his nose.
Every little conjuncture of circumstances which admitted
of litigation, at once suggested its <i>expediency</i>, without reference
to other considerations, or connection with, or subordination
to, any general purpose or plan of action. A
creature of small impulses, he had no idea of foregoing
a momentary advantage to secure an ulterior object of
importance&mdash;which, in fact, he could not keep for a
moment before his thoughts, so as to have any influence
on his movements. What a different man, now, was Gammon!</p>

<p>To speak after the manner of physiologists, several of
my characters&mdash;Titmouse, Tag-rag, (with his amiable
wife and daughter,) Huckaback, Snap, and old Quirk
himself&mdash;may be looked on as reptiles of a low order in
the scale of being, whose simple structures almost one
dash of the knife would suffice to lay thoroughly open.
Gammon, however, I look upon as of a much higher order;
possessing a far more complicated structure, adapted to
the discharge of superior functions; and who, consequently,
requireth a more careful dissection. But let it not be
supposed that I have yet done with <i>any</i> of my characters.</p>

<p>Gammon saw that Tag-rag, under proper management,
might be made very useful. He was a <i>moneyed man</i>; a
selfish man; and, after his sort, an ambitious man. He
had an only child, a daughter, and if Titmouse and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
could only be by any means once more brought together,
and a firm friendship cemented between them, Gammon
saw several very profitable uses to which such an intimacy
might be turned, in the happening of any of several contemplated
contingencies. In the event, for instance, of
larger outlays of money being required than suited the
convenience of the firm&mdash;could not Tag-rag be easily
brought to accommodate his future son-in-law of £10,000
a-year? Suppose that, after all, their case should break
down and all their pains, exertions, and expenditure be
utterly thrown away! Now, if Tag-rag could be quietly
brought, some fine day, to the point of either making an
actual advance, or becoming security for Titmouse&mdash;ah!
that would do&mdash;- that <i>would</i> do, said both Quirk and
Gammon. But then Titmouse was a very unsafe instrument&mdash;an
incalculable fool, and might commit himself
too far!</p>

<p>"You forget, Gammon," said old Mr. Quirk, "I don't
fear this girl of Tag-rag's&mdash;because only let Titmouse
see&mdash;hem," he suddenly paused, and looked a little confused.</p>

<p>"To be sure&mdash;I see," replied Gammon, quietly, and
the thing passed off. "If either Miss Quirk or Miss
Tag-rag becomes Mrs. Titmouse," thought he, "I am not
the man I take myself for."</p>

<p>A few days after Titmouse's expulsion from Satin Lodge,
without his having ever gone near Tag-rag's premises in
Oxford Street, or in short, seen or heard anything about
him, or any one connected with him, Titmouse removed
to small but very respectable lodgings in the neighborhood
of Hatton Garden, provided for him by Mr. Quirk. Mrs.
Squallop was quite affected while she took leave of Titmouse,
who gave her son a penny to take his two boxes
down-stairs to the hackney-coach drawn up opposite to
the entrance of Closet Court.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've always felt like a mother towards you, sir, in my
humble way," said Mrs. Squallop, in a very respectful
manner, and courtesying profoundly.</p>

<p>"A&mdash;I've not got any&mdash;a&mdash;change by me, my good
woman," said Titmouse, with a fine air, as he drew on his
white kid glove.</p>

<p>"Lord, Mr. Titmouse!" said the woman, almost bursting
into tears, "I wasn't asking for money, neither for
me nor mine&mdash;only one can't help, as it were, feeling at
parting with an old lodger, you know, sir"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;ya&mdash;as&mdash;and all that! Well, my good woman,
good-day, good-day!" quoth Titmouse, with an air of languid indifference.</p>

<p>"Good-by, sir&mdash;God bless you, sir, now you're going
to be a rich man!&mdash;Excuse me, sir."&mdash;And she seized
his hand and shook it.</p>

<p>"You're a&mdash;devilish&mdash;impudent&mdash;woman&mdash;'pon
my soul!" exclaimed Titmouse, his features filled with
amazement at the presumption of which she had been
guilty; and he strode down the stairs with an air of
offended dignity.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I never!&mdash;<i>That</i> for you, you little brute,"
exclaimed Mrs. Squallop, snapping her fingers as soon as
she had heard his last step on the stairs&mdash;"Kind or
cruel, it's all one to you!&mdash;You're a nasty jackanapes,
only fit to stand in a tailor's window to show his clothes&mdash;and
I'll be sworn you'll come to no good in the end,
please God! Let you be <i>rich</i> as you may, you'll always
be the fool you always was!"</p>

<p>Had the good woman been familiar with the Night
Thoughts of Dr. Young, she might have expressed herself
somewhat tersely in a line of his&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Pygmies are pygmies still, though perched on Alps."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And, by the way, who can read the next line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And pyramids are pyramids in vales,"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></div></div>

<p>without thinking for a moment, with a kind of proud
sympathy, of certain <i>other</i> characters in this history?
Well! but let us pass on.</p>

<p>The day after that on which Mr. Gammon had had a
long interview with Titmouse, at the new lodgings of the
latter,&mdash;when, after a very skilful effort, he had succeeded
in reconciling Titmouse to a renewal of his acquaintance
with Tag-rag, upon that gentleman's making a complete
and abject apology for his late monstrous conduct,&mdash;Mr.
Gammon wended his way towards Oxford Street, and soon
introduced himself once more to Mr. Tag-rag, who was
standing leaning against one of the counters in his shop
in a musing position, with a pen behind his ear, and his
hands in his breeches' pockets. Ten days had elapsed
since he had expelled the little impostor Titmouse from
Satin Lodge, and during that interval he had neither seen
nor heard anything whatever of him. On now catching
the first glimpse of Mr. Gammon, he started from his
musing posture, not a little disconcerted, and agitation
overspread his coarse deeply-pitted face with a tallowy
hue. What was in the wind? Mr. Gammon coming to
him, so long after what had occurred! Mr. Gammon
who, having found out his error, had discarded Titmouse!
Tag-rag had a mortal dread of Gammon, who seemed to
him to glide like a dangerous snake into the shop, so
quietly, and <i>so deadly</i>! There was something so calm
and imperturbable in his demeanor, so blandly crafty, so
ominously gentle and soft in the tone of his voice, so penetrating
in his eye, and he could throw such an infernal
smile over his features! Tag-rag might be likened to
the animal, suddenly shuddering as he perceives the
glistening folds of the rattlesnake noiselessly moving towards,
or around him, in the long grass. One glimpse of
his blasting beauty of hue, and&mdash;Horror! all is over.</p>

<p>If the splendid bubble of Titmouse's fortune <i>had</i> burst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
in the manner which he had represented, why Gammon
here now? thought Tag-rag. It was with, in truth, a very
poor show of contempt and defiance, that, in answer to
the bland salutation of Gammon, Tag-rag led the way
down the shop into the little room which had been the
scene of such an extraordinary communication concerning
Titmouse on a former occasion.</p>

<p>Gammon commenced, in a mild tone, with a very startling
representation of the criminal liability which Tag-rag
had incurred by his wanton outrage upon Mr. Titmouse;
his own guest, in violation of all the laws of hospitality.
Tag-rag furiously alleged the imposition which had been
practised on him by Titmouse; but seemed quite collapsed
when Gammon assured him that that circumstance would
not afford him the slightest justification. Having satisfied
Tag-rag that he was entirely at the mercy of Titmouse,
who might subject him to both fine and imprisonment,
Mr. Gammon proceeded to open his eyes to their widest
stare of amazement, by assuring him that Titmouse had
been hoaxing him, and that he was really in the dazzling
position in which he had been first represented by Gammon
to Tag-rag; that every week brought him nearer to
the full and uncontrolled enjoyment of an estate in Yorkshire,
worth £10,000 a-year at the very lowest; that it
was becoming an object of increasing anxiety to them
(Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap) to keep him out of
the hands of money-lenders, who, as usual in such cases,
had already scented out their victim, and so forth. Tag-rag
turned very white, and felt sick at heart in the midst
of all his wonder. Oh, and his daughter had lost the
golden prize! and through <i>his</i> misconduct! He could
have sunk into the cellar!&mdash;Mr. Gammon declared that
he could not account for the singular conduct of Mr. Titmouse
on the melancholy occasion in question, except by
referring it to the excellent wines which he had too freely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
partaken of at Satin Lodge, added (said Gammon, with an
exquisite expression of features which perfectly fascinated
Tag-rag) to a "certain tenderer influence" which had
fairly laid prostrate the faculties of the young and enthusiastic
Titmouse; that there could be no doubt of his real
motive in the conduct alluded to, namely, a desire to test
the sincerity and disinterestedness of a "certain person's"
attachment before he let all his fond and passionate feelings
go out towards her&mdash;[At this point the perspiration
burst from every pore in the devoted body of Tag-rag]&mdash;and
that no one could deplore the unexpected issue of
his little experiment so much as now did Titmouse.</p>

<p>Tag-rag really, for a moment, scarcely knew where he
was, who was with him, nor whether he stood on his
head or his heels, so delightful and entirely unexpected
was the issue of Mr. Gammon's visit. As soon as his
faculties had somewhat recovered themselves from their
temporary confusion, almost breathless, he assured Gammon
that no event in the whole course of his life had
occasioned him such poignant regret as his treatment of
Titmouse on the occasion in question; that he had undoubtedly
followed unwittingly (he was ashamed to
own) the example of Titmouse, and drank far more than
his usual quantity of wine; besides which he had undoubtedly
noticed, as had Mrs. T., the state of things
between Mr. Titmouse and his daughter&mdash;talking of
whom, by the way, he could assure Mr. Gammon that
both Mrs. and Miss T. had been ill ever since that unfortunate
evening, and had never ceased to condemn
his&mdash;Tag-rag's&mdash;monstrous conduct on that occasion. As
for Miss T., she was growing thinner and thinner every
day, and he thought he must send her to the country
for a short time: in fact&mdash;poor girl!&mdash;she was plainly
pining away!</p>

<p>To all this Mr. Gammon listened with a calm, delightful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
sympathizing look, which quite transported Tag-rag,
and satisfied him that Mr. Gammon implicitly believed
every word that was being said to him. But when he
proceeded to assure Tag-rag that this visit of his had
been undertaken at the earnest instance of Mr. Titmouse
himself, (who, by the way, had removed to lodgings which
would do for the present, so as they were only near to
their office, for the purpose of frequent communication on
matters of business between him and their firm,) who
had urged Mr. Gammon to tender the olive branch, in
the devout hope that it might be accepted&mdash;Tag-rag's
excitement knew scarce any bounds; and he could almost
have started into the shop, and given orders to his
shopmen to shut up shop half an hour earlier for the
rest of the week! Mr. Gammon wrote down Titmouse's
direction, and handing it to Mr. Tag-rag, assured him
that a call from him would be gratefully received by Mr.
Titmouse. "There's no accounting for these things,
Mr. Tag-rag&mdash;is there?" said Mr. Gammon, with an
arch smile, as he prepared to depart&mdash;Tag-rag squeezing
his hands with painful energy as Gammon bade him
adieu, declaring that "he should not be himself for the
rest of the day" and bowing the aforesaid Mr. Gammon
down the shop with as profound an obsequiousness as
if he had been the Lord High Chancellor, or even the
Lord Mayor. As soon as Gammon had got fairly into the
street, and to a safe distance, he burst into little gentle
paroxysms of laughter, every now and then, which lasted
him till he had regained his office in Saffron Hill.</p>

<p>The motive so boldly and skilfully suggested by Gammon
to Tag-rag, as that impelling Titmouse to seek a
reconciliation with him, was greedily credited by Tag-rag.
'Tis certainly very easy for a man to believe what he
wishes to be true. Was it <i>very</i> improbable that Tag-rag,
loving only one object on earth, (next to money, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
indeed he really did love with the best and holiest energies
of his nature,) namely, his daughter; and believing
her to be possessed of qualities calculated to excite every
one's love&mdash;should believe that she had inspired Titmouse
with the passion of which he had just been hearing&mdash;a
passion which was consuming him&mdash;which could
not be quenched by even the gross outrage which&mdash;&mdash; but
faugh! <i>that</i> Tag-rag shuddered to think of. He
clapped his hat on his head, and started off to Titmouse's
lodgings, and fortunately caught that gentleman just as
he was going out to dine at a neighboring tavern. If
Tag-rag had been a keen observer, he could hardly have
failed to discover aversion towards himself written in
every feature and gesture of Titmouse; and also the
difficulty which he experienced in concealing his feelings.
But his eagerness overbore everything; and took Titmouse
quite by storm. Before Tag-rag had done with
him, he had obliterated every trace of resentment in his
little friend's bosom. Thoroughly as Gammon thought
he had armed Titmouse against the encounter&mdash;indeed,
at all points&mdash;'twas of no avail. Tag-rag poured such a
monstrous quantity of flummery down the gaping mouth
and insatiate throat of the little animal, as at length produced
its desired effect. Few can resist flattery, however
coarsely administered; but as for Titmouse, he felt the
delicious fluid softly insinuating itself into every crevice of
his little nature, for which it seemed, indeed, to have a
peculiar affinity; 'twas a balm, 'twas an opiate soothing
his wounded pride, lubricating all his inner man;
nay, flooding it, so as at length to extinguish entirely the
very small glimmering spark of discernment which nature
had lit in him. "To be fore<i>warned</i>, is to be fore<i>armed</i>,"
says the proverb; but it was not verified in the present
instance. Titmouse would have dined at Satin Lodge on
the very next Sunday, in accordance with the pressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
invitations of Tag-rag, but that he happened to recollect
having engaged himself to dine on that evening with Mr.
Quirk, at his residence in Camberwell&mdash;<span class="smcap">Alibi House</span>.
As I have already intimated in a previous part of this
history, that most respectable old gentleman, Mr. Quirk,
with the shrewdness natural to him, and which had been
quickened by his great experience, had soon seen through
the ill-contrived and worse-concealed designs upon Titmouse
of Mr. Tag-rag; and justly considered that the
surest method of rendering them abortive would be to familiarize
Titmouse with a superior style of things, such as
was to be found at Alibi House&mdash;and a more lovely and
attractive object for his best affections in Miss Quirk&mdash;Dora
Quirk&mdash;the lustre of whose charms and accomplishments
there could be no doubt, he thought, would
instantly efface the image of that poor, feeble, vulgar
creature, Miss Tag-rag; for such old Quirk knew her to
be, though he had, in fact, never for a moment set eyes
upon her. Mr. Tag-rag looked rather blank at hearing
of the grand party there was to be at Alibi House, and
that Titmouse was to be introduced to the only daughter
of Mr. Quirk, and could not for the life of him abstain
from dropping something, vague and indistinct to be
sure, about "entrapping unsuspecting innocence," and
"interested attentions," and other similar expressions&mdash;all
of which, however, were lost upon Titmouse. Tapping
with an auctioneer's hammer on a block of granite,
would make about as much impression upon it as will
hint, innuendo, or suggestion, upon a blockhead. So it
was with Titmouse. He promised to dine at Satin Lodge
on the Sunday after the ensuing one&mdash;with which poor
Mr. Tag-rag was obliged to depart content; having been
unable to get Titmouse up to Clapham on either of the
intervening evenings, on which, he told Mr. Tag-rag, he
was particularly engaged with an intimate friend&mdash;"in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
fact, one of <span class="smcap">his solicitors</span>;" and Tag-rag left him after
shaking him by the hand with the utmost cordiality and
energy. He instantly conceived a lively hatred of old
Mr. Quirk and his daughter, who seemed taking so unfair
an advantage. What, however, could be done? Many
times during his interview did he anxiously turn about
in his mind the expediency of proffering to lend or give
Titmouse a five-pound note, of which he had one or two
in his pocket-book; but no&mdash;'twas too much for human
nature&mdash;he <i>could</i> not bring himself to it; and quitted
Titmouse as rich a man as he had entered that gentleman's
lodgings.</p>

<p>The "intimate friend" to whom Titmouse alluded as
having engaged himself to dinner with him, was, in fact,
Mr. Snap; who had early evinced a great partiality for
him, and lost no opportunity of contributing to his enjoyment.
Snap was a sharp-sighted person, and quickly detected
many qualities in Titmouse, kindred to his own.
He sincerely commiserated Titmouse's situation, than
which, could anything be more lonely and desolate?
Was he to sit night after night in the lengthening nights
of autumn and winter, with not a soul to speak to, not a
book to read, (that was at least interesting or worth reading;)
nothing, in short, to occupy his attention? "No,"
said Snap to himself; "I will do as I would be done by;
I will come and draw him out of his dull hole; I will
show him life&mdash;I will give him an early insight into the
habits and practices of the great world, in which he is so
soon to cut a leading figure! I will early familiarize him
with the gayest and most exciting modes of London life!"
The very first taste of this cup of pleasure was exquisitely
relished by Titmouse; and he felt a proportionate gratitude
to him whose kind hand had first raised it to his
lips. Scenes of which he had heretofore only heard and
read&mdash;after which he had often sighed and yearned, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
now opening daily before him, limited as were his means;
and he felt perfectly happy. When Snap had finished
the day's labors of the office, from which he was generally
released about eight or nine o'clock in the evening,
he would repair to his lodgings, and decorate himself for
the night's display; after which, either he would go to
Titmouse, or Titmouse come to him, as might have been
previously agreed upon between them; and then,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The <i>town</i> was all before them, where to choose!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sometimes they would, arm in arm, each with his cigar
in his mouth, saunter, for hours together, along the leading
streets and thoroughfares, making acute observations
and deep reflections upon the ever-moving and motley
scenes around them. Most frequently, however, they
would repair, at half-price, to the theatres; for Snap
had the means of securing almost a constant supply of
"orders" from the underlings of the theatres, and also
from reporters to the <i>Sunday Flash</i>, (with which Messrs.
Quirk and Gammon were connected,) and other newspapers.
Ah, 'twas a glorious sight to see these two gentlemen
saunter into a vacant box, conscious that the eyes of
two-thirds of the house were fixed upon them in admiration,
and conducting themselves accordingly&mdash;as swells
of the first water! One such night counterbalanced, in
Titmouse's estimation, a whole year of his previous obscurity
and wretchedness! The theatre over, they would repair
to some cloudy tavern, full of noise and smoke, and
the glare of gaslight&mdash;redolent of the fragrant fumes of
tobacco, gin, and porter, intermingled with the tempting
odors of smoking kidneys, mutton-chops, beefsteaks, oysters,
stewed cheese, toasted cheese, Welsh rabbits; where
those who are chained to the desk and the counter during
the day, revel in the license of the hour, and eat, and
drink, and smoke to the highest point either of excitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
or stupefaction, and enter into all the slang of the
day&mdash;of the turf, the ring, the cockpit, the theatres&mdash;and
shake their sides at comic songs. To enter one of
these places when the theatre was over, was a luxury indeed
to Titmouse; figged out in his very uttermost best,
with satin stock and double breastpins; his glossy hat
cocked on one side of his head, his tight blue surtout,
with the snowy handkerchief elegantly drooping out of
the breast-pocket; straw-colored kid gloves, tight trousers,
and shining boots; his ebony silver-headed cane
held carelessly under his arm! To walk into the middle
of the room with a sort of haughty ease and indifference,
or nonchalance; and after deliberately scanning,
through his eye-glass, every box, with its occupants, at
length drop into a vacant nook, and with a languid air
summon the bustling waiter to receive his commands, was
ecstasy! The circumstance of his almost always accompanying
Snap on these occasions, who was held in great
awe by the waiters, to whom his professional celebrity was
well known, (for there was scarce an interesting, a dreadful,
or a nasty scene at any of the police-offices, in which
Snap's name did not figure in the newspapers as "appearing
on behalf of the prisoner,") got Titmouse almost an
equal share of consideration, and aided the effect produced
by his own commanding appearance. As for Snap, whenever
he was asked who his companion was, he would whisper
in a very significant tone and manner&mdash;"Devilish
high chap!" From these places they would repair, not
unfrequently, to certain other scenes of nightly London
life, which, I thank God! the virtuous reader can form
no notion of, though they are, strange to say, winked at,
if not patronized by the police and magistracy, till the
metropolis is choked with them. Thus would Snap and
Titmouse pleasantly pass away their time till one, two,
three, and often four o'clock in the morning; at which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
hours they would, with many yawns, skulk homewards
through the deserted and silent streets, their clothes redolent
of tobacco smoke, their stomachs overcharged, their
heads often muddled, swimming, and throbbing with their
multifarious potations&mdash;having thus spent a "<i>jolly night</i>,"
and "<i>seen life</i>." 'T&nbsp;was thus that Snap greatly endeared
himself to Titmouse, and secretly (for he enjoined upon
Titmouse, as the condition of their continuance, strict secrecy
on the subject of these nocturnal adventures) stole
a march upon his older competitors for the good opinion
of Titmouse&mdash;Messrs. Quirk, Tag-rag, and even the astute
and experienced Gammon himself. Such doings as these
required, however, as may easily be believed, some slight
augmentations of the allowance made to Titmouse by
Messrs. Quirk and Gammon; and it was fortunate that
Snap was in a condition, having a few hundreds at his
command, to supply the necessities of Titmouse, receiving
with a careless air, on the occasion of such advances,
small slips of paper by way of acknowledgments; some on
stamped paper, others on unstamped paper,&mdash;promissory
notes, and I. O. U's. Inasmuch, however, as Snap
was not always possessed of a stamp on the occasion of
a sudden advance, and having asked the opinion of his
pleader (a sharp fellow who had been articled at the
same time as himself to Messrs. Quirk and Gammon)
as to whether an instrument in this form, "I. O. U. so
much&mdash;<i>with interest</i>," would be available without a
stamp, and being informed that it was a very doubtful
point, Snap ingeniously met the difficulty by quietly adding
to the principal what might become due in respect of
interest: <i>e.&nbsp;g.</i> if £5 were lent, the acknowledgment would
stand for £15&mdash;these little slips of paper being generally
signed by Titmouse in moments of extreme exhilaration,
when he never thought of scrutinizing anything
that his friend Snap would lay before him. For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
honor of Snap, I must say that I hardly think he deliberately
purposed to perpetuate the fraud which such a
transaction appears to amount to; all he wanted was&mdash;so
he satisfied himself at least&mdash;to have it in his power
to recover the full amount of principal <i>really</i> advanced,
with interest, on one or other of these various securities,
and hold the surplus as trustee for Titmouse. If, for instance,
any unfortunate difference should hereafter arise
between himself and Titmouse, and he should refuse to
recognize his pecuniary obligations to Snap, the latter
gentleman would be provided with short and easy proofs
of his demands against him. 'T&nbsp;was thus, I say, that
Snap rendered himself indispensable to Titmouse, whom
he bound to him by every tie of gratitude; so that, in
short, they became sworn friends.</p>

<p>I will always say for Gammon, that, whatever might
have been his motive, he strenuously endeavored to urge
upon Titmouse the necessity of acquiring, at all events, a
smattering of the elements of useful education. Beyond
an acquaintance with the petty operations of arithmetic
requisite for counter-transactions, I will venture to say
that poor Titmouse had no serviceable knowledge of any
kind. Mr. Gammon repeatedly pressed him to put himself
under competent teachers of the ordinary branches
of education; but Titmouse as often evaded him, and at
length flatly refused to do anything of the kind. He
promised, however, to read such books as Mr. Gammon
might recommend; who thereupon sent him several: but
a book before Titmouse was much the same as a plate of
sawdust before a hungry man. Mr. Gammon, himself a
man of considerable acquirements, soon saw the true state
of the case, and gave up his attempts in despair and disgust.
Not that he ever suffered Titmouse to perceive the
faintest indication of such feelings towards him; on the
contrary, Gammon ever exhibited the same bland and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
benignant demeanor, consulting his wishes in everything,
and striving to instil into him feelings of love, tempered
by respect, as towards the most powerful&mdash;the only real,
disinterested friend he had! To a very great extent he succeeded.</p>

<p>Titmouse spent several hours in preparing for an effective
first appearance at the dinner-table at Alibi House.
Since dining at Satin Lodge, he had considerably increased
his wardrobe both in quantity and style. He now sported
a pair of tight black trousers, with pumps and gossamer
silk stockings. He wore a crimson velvet waistcoat, with
a bright blue satin under-waistcoat, a shirt-frill standing
out somewhat fiercely at right angles with his breast, and
a brown dress-coat cut in the extreme of the fashion, the
long tails coming to a point just about the backs of his
knees. His hair (its purple hue still pretty distinctly
perceptible) was disposed with great elegance. He had
discarded mustaches; but had a very promising imperial.
The hair underneath his chin came out curling on each
side of it, above his stock, like two little tufts or horns.
Over his waistcoat he wore his mosaic gold watch-guard,
and a broad black watered ribbon, to which was attached
his eye-glass&mdash;in fact, if he had dressed himself in order
to sit to a miniature painter for his likeness, he could not
have taken greater pains, or secured a more successful result.
The only points about his appearance with which
he was at all dissatisfied, were his hair&mdash;which was not
yet the thing which he hoped in due time to see it&mdash;his
thick red stumpy hands, and his round shoulders.
The last matter gave him considerable concern, for he felt
that it seriously interfered with a graceful carriage; and
that the defect in his figure had been, after all, not in the
least remedied by the prodigious padding of his coat. His
protuberant eyes, of very light hue, had an expression entirely
harmonizing with that of his open mouth; and both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
together, quite independently of his dress, carriage, and demeanor&mdash;(there
is nothing like being candid)&mdash;gave you
the image of a&mdash;complete fool. Having at length carefully
adjusted his hat on his head, and drawn on his white
kid gloves, he enveloped himself in a stylish cloak, with
long black silk tassels, which had been lent to him by Snap;
and about four o'clock, forth sallied Mr. Titmouse, carefully
picking his way, in quest of the first coach that could
convey him to Alibi House, or as near to it as might be.
He soon found one, and, conscious that his appearance was
far too splendid for an outside place, got inside. All the
way along, his heart was in a little flutter of vanity, excitement,
and expectation. He was going to be introduced
to Miss Quirk&mdash;and probably, also, to several
people of great consequence&mdash;as the heir apparent to
£10,000 a-year! Two very respectable female passengers,
his companions, he never once deigned to interchange,
a syllable with. Four or five times did he put
his head out of the window, calling out in a loud peremptory
tone&mdash;"Mind, coachman&mdash;Alibi House&mdash;Mr.
Quirk's&mdash;Alibi House&mdash;Do you hear, demme?" After
which he would sink back into the seat with a magnificent
air, as if he had not been used to give himself so
much trouble. The coach at length stopped. "Hallibi
Ouse, sir," said the coachman, in a most respectful tone&mdash;"this
is Mr. Quirk's, sir." Titmouse stepped out, dropped
eighteenpence into the man's hand, and opening the gate,
found himself in a straight and narrow gravel walk, of
about twenty yards in length, with little obstinate-looking
stunted shrubs on each side. 'T&nbsp;was generally known,
among Mr. Quirk's friends, by the name of "the <i>Rope-walk</i>."
Titmouse might have entered before as fine-looking a house,
but only to deliver a bundle of drapery or hosiery: never
before had he entered such an one in the reality of guest.
It was, in fact, a fair-sized house, at least treble that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
Satin Lodge, and had a far more stylish appearance.
When Titmouse pulled the bell, the door was quickly
plucked open by a big footman, with showy shoulder-knot
and a pair of splendid red plush breeches, who soon
disposed of Titmouse's cloak and hat, and led the way
to the drawing-room, before our friend, with a sudden
palpitation of the heart, had had a moment's time even
to run his hands through his hair.</p>

<p>"Your name, sir?" inquired the man, suddenly pausing&mdash;with
his hand upon the handle of the door.</p>

<p>"Mr. Titmouse!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;<i>beg</i> your pardon, sir; <i>what</i> name?"</p>

<p>Titmouse clearing his throat repeated his name&mdash;open
went the door, and&mdash;"Mr. Ticklemouse," said the servant,
very loudly and distinctly&mdash;ushering in Titmouse;
on whom the door was the next instant closed. He felt
amazingly flustered&mdash;and he would have been still more
so, if he could have been made aware of the titter which
pervaded the fourteen or twenty people assembled in the
room, occasioned by the droll misnomer of the servant,
and the exquisitely ridiculous appearance of poor Titmouse.
Mr. Quirk, dressed in black, with knee breeches
and silk stockings, immediately bustled up to him, shook
him cordially by the hand, and led him up to the assembled
guests. "My daughter&mdash;Miss Quirk; Mrs. Alderman
Addlehead; Mrs. Deputy Diddle-daddle; Mrs.
Alias, my sister;&mdash;Mr. Alderman Addlehead; Mr. Deputy
Diddle-daddle; Mr. Bluster; Mr. Slang; Mr. Hug;
Mr. Flaw; Mr. Viper; Mr. Ghastly; Mr. Gammon you
know." Miss Quirk was about four or five and twenty&mdash;a
fat young lady, with flaxen hair curled formally all
over her head and down to her shoulders; so that she
very much resembled one of those great wax dolls seen
in bazaars and shop windows. Her complexion was beautifully
fair; her eyes were small; her face was quite round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
and fat. From the die-away manner in which she moved
her head, and the languid tone of her voice, it was obvious
that she was a very sentimental young lady. She
was dressed in white, and wore a massive gold chain&mdash;her
fat arms being half covered with long kid gloves. She
was sitting on the sofa, from which she did not rise when
Titmouse was introduced to her&mdash;and the moment afterwards,
hid her face behind the album which had been lying
on her knee, and which she had been showing to the
ladies on each side of her; for, in fact, neither she nor
any one else could, without the greatest difficulty, refrain
from laughing at the monkeyfied appearance of Titmouse.
The alderman was a stout, stupid little man&mdash;a fussy
old prig&mdash;with small angry-looking black eyes, and a
short red nose; as for his head, it seemed as though he
had just smeared some sticky fluid over it, and then
dipped it into a flour-tub, so thickly laden was it with
powder. Mr. Deputy Diddle-daddle was tall and thin,
and serious and slow of speech, with the solemn composure
of an undertaker. Mr. Bluster was a great Old
Bailey barrister, about fifty years old, the leader constantly
employed by Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap;
and was making at least a thousand a-year. He had an
amazingly truculent-looking countenance, coarse to a degree,
and his voice matched it; but on occasions like the
present&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in elegant society&mdash;he would fain drop the
successful terrors of his manner, and appear the mild,
dignified gentleman. He therefore spoke in a very soft,
cringing way, with an anxious smile; but his bold insolent
eye and coarse mouth&mdash;what could disguise or mitigate
their expression? Here he was, playing the great
man; making himself, however, most particularly agreeable
to Messrs. Quirk and Gammon. Slang was of the
same school; fat, vulgar, confident, and empty; telling
obscene jokes and stories, in a deep bass voice. He sang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
a good song, too&mdash;particularly of that class which required
the absence of ladies&mdash;and of <i>gentlemen</i>. Hug
(Mr. Toady Hug) was also a barrister; a glib little Jewish-looking
fellow, creeping into considerable criminal practice.
He was a sneaking backbiter, and had a blood-hound scent
after an attorney. See him, for instance, at this moment,
in close and eager conversation with Mr. Flaw, who, rely
upon it, will give him a brief before the week is over.
Viper was the editor of the <i>Sunday Flash</i>; a cold, venomous
little creature. He was a philosopher&mdash;and of
opinion that everything was wrong&mdash;moral, physical,
intellectual, and social; that there was really no such
thing, or at least ought not to be, as religion; and, as to
political rights, that everybody was equal, and if any were
uppermost, all ought to be! He had failed in business
twice, and disreputably; then had become an Unitarian
parson; but, having seduced a young female member of
his congregation, he was expelled from his pulpit. An
action being brought against him by the mother of his
victim, and heavy damages obtained, he attempted to
take the benefit of the Insolvent Debtors' Act&mdash;but, on
account of Miss&mdash;&mdash;, was remanded for eighteen months.
That period he employed in writing a shockingly blasphemous
work, for which he was prosecuted, and sentenced
to a heavy fine and imprisonment. On being released
from prison, saturated with gall and bitterness against
all mankind, he took to political writing of a very violent
character, and was at length picked up, half starved, by
his present patron, Mr. Quirk, and made editor of the
<i>Sunday Flash</i>. Is not all this history written in his
sallow, sinister-eyed, bitter-expressioned countenance?
Woe to him who gets into a discussion with Viper!
There were one or two others present, particularly a
Mr. Ghastly, a third-rate tragic actor, with a tremendous
mouth, only one eye, and a very hungry look. He never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
spoke, because no one spoke to him, for his clothes seemed
rather rusty black. The only man of gentlemanlike appearance
in the room was Mr. Gammon; and he took an
early opportunity of engaging poor Titmouse in conversation,
and setting him comparatively at his ease&mdash;a thing
which was attempted by old Quirky, but in such a fidgety-fussy
way as served only to fluster Titmouse the more.
Mr. Quirk gave a dinner-party of this sort regularly
every Sunday; and they formed the happiest moments
of his life&mdash;occasions on which he <i>felt</i> that he had
achieved success in life&mdash;on which he banished from
his thoughts the responsible and dignified anxieties of
his profession; and, surrounded by a select circle of
choice spirits, such as were thus collected together,
partook joyously of the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Feast of reason, and the flow of soul."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"This is a very beautiful picture, Mr. Titmouse, isn't
it?" said Gammon, leading him to the farther corner of
the drawing-room, where hung a small picture, with a sort
of curtain of black gauze before it. Gammon lifted it up;
and Titmouse beheld a picture of a man suspended from
the gallows, his hands tied with cords before him, his head
forced aside, and covered down to the chin with a white
nightcap. 'Twas done with sickening fidelity; and Titmouse
gazed at it with a shudder. "Charming thing,
isn't it?" said Gammon, with a very expressive smile.</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;e&mdash;e&mdash;s," replied Titmouse, his eyes glued to
the horrid object.</p>

<p>"Very striking thing, that&mdash;a'n't it?" quoth Quirk,
bustling up to them; "'twas painted for me by a first-rate
artist, whose brother I <i>very nearly</i> saved from the gallows!
<i>Like</i> such things?" he inquired with a matter-of-fact air,
drawing down the black gauze.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir, uncommon&mdash;most uncommon!" quoth Titmouse, shuddering.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll show you something most particular interesting!
Heard of Gilderoy, that was hanged for forgery?
Gad, my daughter's got a brooch with a lock of his
hair in it, which he gave me himself&mdash;a client of mine;
within an ace of getting him off&mdash;flaw in the indictment&mdash;found
it out myself&mdash;did, by gad! Come along, and
I'll get Dora to show it to you!" and, putting Titmouse's
arm in his, and desirous of withdrawing him from Gammon,
he led him up to the interesting young lady.</p>

<p>"Dora," said Mr. Quirk&mdash;"just show my friend Titmouse
that brooch of yours, with Gilderoy's hair."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear papa, 't&nbsp;is such a melancholy thing!"
said she, at the same time detaching it from her dress,
and handing it to her papa, who, holding it in his hands,
gave Titmouse, and one or two others who stood beside,
a very interesting account of the last hours of the deceased
Gilderoy.</p>

<p>"He was <i>very</i> handsome, papa, wasn't he?" inquired
Miss Quirk, with a sigh, and a very pensive air.</p>

<p>"Wasn't bad-looking; but good looks and the condemned
cell don't long agree together, <i>I</i> can tell you!&mdash;Had
many"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, papa!" exclaimed Miss Quirk, in a mournful
tone, and, leaning back in the sofa, raised her handkerchief
to her eyes.</p>

<p>"You are too sensitive, my love!" whispered her aunt,
Mrs. Alias, squeezing the hand of her niece, who, struggling
against her feelings, presently revived.</p>

<p>"We were looking just now," said Mr. Hug, addressing
Mr. Quirk, "at a very interesting addition to Miss
Quirk's splendid album&mdash;that letter of Grizzlegut."</p>

<p>"Ah, very striking! Value it beyond everything!
Shall never forget Grizzlegut! Very nearly got him off!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
'T was an '&amp;c.' that nearly saved his life, through being
omitted in the indictment. 'Fore gad, we thought we'd
got 'em!"</p>

<p>They were alluding to an autograph letter which had
been addressed to Mr. Quirk by Grizzlegut, (who had been
executed for high treason a few weeks before,) the night
before he suffered. He was a blood-stained scoundrel of
the deepest dye, and ought to have been hanged and
quartered half a dozen times.</p>

<p>"Will you read it aloud, Mr. Hug?" inquired Miss
Quirk; and the barrister, with solemn emphasis, read
the following remarkable document:&mdash;</p>

<p>The reading of the above produced a great sensation.
"That man's name will be enrolled among the Sidneys
and the Hampdens of his country!" said Viper, with a
grim and excited air. "That letter deserves to be carved
on a golden tablet! The last four lines are sublime!
They are worthy of Milton! He was a martyr to principles
that are silently and rapidly making their way in
this country!"&mdash;How much farther he would have gone
on in this strain, seeing no one present had resolution
enough to differ with or interrupt him, even if they had
been so disposed, I know not; but fortunately dinner was
announced&mdash;a sound which startled old Quirk out of a
posture of intense attention to Viper, and evident admiration
of his sentiments. He gave his arm with an air of
prodigious politeness to the gaunt Mrs. Alderman Addlehead,
whose distinguished lord led down Miss Quirk&mdash;and
the rest followed in no particular order&mdash;Titmouse
arm in arm with Gammon, who took care to place him
next to himself (Gammon). It was really a dashing sort
of dinner&mdash;such, indeed, as Mr. Quirk had long been
celebrated for. Titmouse had never seen anything like
it, and was quite bewildered&mdash;particularly at the number
of differently shaped and colored glasses, &amp;c. &amp;c. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>&amp;c.,
appropriated to his individual use! He kept a constant eye
on the movements of Gammon, and did whatever he did
(the two appearing moved by the same set of springs),
and was thus saved not a few embarrassments and annoyances.
What chiefly struck his attention was a prodigious
number of dishes, great and small, as if half a dozen dinners
had been crowded into one; the rapidity with which
they were changed, and plates removed, in constant succession;
the incessant invitations to take wine, flying
about during the whole of dinner. For a considerable
while he was too much flurried to enjoy himself; but a
few glasses of champagne succeeded in elevating his
spirits to the proper pitch&mdash;and (had he not been
checked) would soon have driven them far beyond it.
Almost everybody, except the great folk at the very top
of the table, asked him to take wine; and on every such
occasion he filled his glass. In fact Gammon, recollecting
a scene at his own chamber, soon perceived that, unless
he interfered, Titmouse would be drunk long before dinner
was over. That gentleman had not imagined the earth
to contain so exquisite a drink as champagne; and he
could have fallen down and worshipped it, as it came
fizzing and flashing out of the bottle. Gammon earnestly
assured him that he would be ill if he drank so much&mdash;that
many eyes were upon him&mdash;and that it was not the
custom to do more than merely sip from his wine-glass
when challenging or challenged. But Titmouse had
taken a considerably greater quantity on board, before
Gammon thus interfered, than that gentleman was aware
of; and began to get very confident and voluble. Guess
the progress he had made, when he called out with a confident
air&mdash;"Mr. Alderman! Your health!"&mdash;whether
more to that great man's astonishment, or disgust, I
cannot undertake to say: but after a steady stare for a
moment or two at Titmouse, "Oh! I shall be very happy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
indeed, <i>Mr. Gammon</i>," he called out, looking at the latter
gentleman, and drinking with <i>him</i>. That signified nothing,
however, to Titmouse, who, indeed, did not see anything
at all pointed or unusual, and nodding confidently to the
alderman, gulped down his wine as eagerly as before.</p>

<p>"Cool puppy, that, Miss Quirk, must say," snuffled the
offended alderman, to Miss Quirk.</p>

<p>"He's young, dear Mr. Alderman," said she, sweetly
and mildly&mdash;"and when you consider the immense fortune
he is coming into&mdash;ten thousand a-year, my papa
says"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"That don't make him less a puppy&mdash;nor a brute,"
interrupted the ruffled alderman, still more indignant;
for his own forty thousand pounds, the source of all his
social eminence, sank into insignificance at the sound of
the splendid income just about to drop into the lap of
Titmouse. Mr. Bluster, who headed the table on Miss
Quirk's left hand side, and who felt that he <i>ought</i> to be,
but knew that in the presence of the alderman he <i>was</i>
not, the great man of the day, observing the irritation
under which his rival was suffering, resolved to augment
it as much as possible: wherefore he immediately raised
his threatening double-glasses to his eyes, and in a tone of
ostentatious condescension, looking down the table to Titmouse,
called out, "Mr. Titmash&mdash;may I have the honor
of drinking wine with you?"</p>

<p>"Ya&mdash;as, brother Bumptious," replied Titmouse, (who
could never bear to hear his name mispronounced,) and
raised <i>his</i> glass to his eye; "was just going to ask <i>you</i>!"
All this was done in such a loud and impudent tone and
manner, as made Gammon still more uneasy for his young
companion. But his sally had been received by the company
as a very smart retort, and produced a roar of laughter,
every one being glad to see Mr. Bluster snubbed, who
bore it in silent dignity, though his face showed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
chagrin and astonishment; and he very heartily agreed,
for once in his life, with the worshipful person opposite
to him, in his estimate of our friend Titmouse. "Mr.
Titmouse! Mr. Titmouse! my daughter wonders you won't
take wine with her," said Mr. Quirk, in a low tone&mdash;"will
you join us? we're going to take a glass of champagne."</p>

<p>"Oh! 'pon my life&mdash;delighted"&mdash;quoth Titmouse.</p>

<p>"Dora, my dear! Mr. Titmouse will take wine with
you!&mdash;Jack," (to the servant,) "fill Miss Quirk's and
Mr. Titmouse's glasses to the brim."</p>

<p>"Oh no! <i>dearest</i> papa&mdash;&mdash; gracious!" she exclaimed,
removing her glass.</p>

<p>"Pho! pho!&mdash;nonsense&mdash;the first time of asking,
you know, ah, ha!"</p>

<p>"Well! If it <i>must</i> be," and with what a graceful inclination&mdash;with
what a sly searching glance, and fascinating
smile, did she exchange courtesies with Titmouse! He
felt disposed to take wine with her a second time immediately;
but Gammon restrained him. Mr. Toady Hug,
having become acquainted with the brilliant prospects of
Titmouse, earnestly desired to exert his little talents to
do the agreeable, and ingratiate himself with Mr. Titmouse;
but there was a counteracting force in another
direction&mdash;viz. the attorney, Mr. Flaw, who had the
greatest practice at the Clerkenwell sessions; who sat
beside him and received his most respectful and incessant
attentions; Hug speaking ever to him in a low confidential
whisper, constantly casting a furtive glance towards Bluster
and Slang, to see whether they were observing him.
In "strict confidence" he assured Mr. Flaw how his case,
the other day, might have been won, if such and such a
course had been adopted, "which would have been the
line <i>he</i>" (Hug) "would have taken;" and which he explained
with anxious energy. "I must say, (but don't
mention it!) that Mr. Flip regularly threw the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
away&mdash;no doubt of it! By the way, what became of that
burglary case of yours, on Friday, Mr. Flaw? Uncommonly
interesting case!"</p>

<p>"Found guilty, poor fellows!"</p>

<p>"You don't say so?"</p>

<p>"Fact, by Jove, though!"</p>

<p>"How <i>could</i> Mr. Gobble have lost that verdict? I
assure you I would have bet ten to one on your getting
a verdict; for I read over your brief as it lay beside me,
and upon my honor, Mr. Flaw, it was most admirably
got up. Everything depends on the brief"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Glad you thought so, sir," replied Flaw, wondering
how it was that he had never before thought of giving
a brief to Mr. Hug.</p>

<p>"It's a great mistake of counsel," quoth Hug, earnestly&mdash;"not
to pay the utmost attention to their briefs! For
my part," he continued in a lower tone, "I make a point
of reading every syllable in <i>my</i> brief, however long it is!"</p>

<p>"It's the only way, depend on it, sir. We attorneys,
you know, see and know so much of the case, conversing
confidentially with the prisoners"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ay, and beyond that&mdash;Your practical suggestions,
my dear sir, are often&mdash;&mdash; Now, for instance, in the brief
I was alluding to, there was, I recollect&mdash;one most&mdash;uncommonly
acute suggestion"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir&mdash;you're uncommonly flattering! Am particularly
obliged to you! May I ask, what it was that struck
you?"&mdash;inquired the attorney, briskly, his countenance
showing the progress of Hug's lubricating process.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;why&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;hem!" stammered Hug, somewhat
nonplussed&mdash;(for his little fiction had been accepted
as a fact!) "No; it would hardly be fair to
Gobble, and I'm sorry indeed"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, well&mdash;it can't be helped <i>now</i>&mdash;but I must
say that once or twice latterly I've thought, myself, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
Mr. Gobble has rather&mdash;&mdash; By the way, Mr. Hug, shall
you be in town this week, till the end of the sessions?"</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;e&mdash;s!" hastily whispered Hug, after glancing
guiltily towards his brethren, who, though they did not
seem to do so, were really watching him with ill-subdued fury.</p>

<p>"I'm happy to hear it!&mdash;You've heard of Aaron
Doodle, who was committed for that burglary at&mdash;&mdash;?
Well, I defend him, and shall be happy to give you the
brief. Do you lead Mr. Dolt?" Hug nodded. "Then
he will be your junior. Where are your chambers, Mr. Hug?"</p>

<p>"No. 4, Cant Court, Gray's Inn. When, my dear sir,
does the case come on?"</p>

<p>"Thursday&mdash;perhaps Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Then <i>do</i> come and breakfast with me," quoth Hug,
in a whisper&mdash;"and we can talk it over, you know, so
nicely together!"</p>

<p>"Sir, you're <i>very</i> polite. I will do myself the
pleasure"&mdash;replied Mr. Flaw&mdash;- and good-naturedly took wine
with Mr. Hug.</p>

<p>This little stroke of business over, the disengaged couple
were at liberty to attend to the general conversation of
the table. Mr. Bluster and Mr. Slang kept the company
in almost a constant roar, with descriptions of scenes in
court, in which <i>they</i> had, of course, been the principal
actors; and according to their own accounts they must
have been wonderful fellows. Such botherers of judges&mdash;particularly
aldermen and police magistrates!&mdash;Such
bafflers and browbeaters of witnesses!&mdash;Such bamboozlers
of juries!</p>

<p>You should have seen the sneering countenance of Hug
all the while. He never once smiled or laughed at the
brilliant sallies of his brethren, and did his best to prevent
his new patron, Mr. Flaw, from doing so&mdash;constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
putting his hand before his mouth, and whispering into
Mr. Flaw's ear at the very point of the joke or story&mdash;and
the smile would disappear from the countenance of
Mr. Flaw.</p>

<p>The alderman laughed till the tears ran out of his little
eyes, which he constantly wiped with his napkin! Amid
the general laughter and excitement, Miss Quirk, leaning
her chin on her hand, her elbow resting on the table, several
times directed soft, languishing looks towards Titmouse,
unobserved by any one but himself; and they were not
entirely unsuccessful, although Titmouse was wonderfully
taken with the stories of the two counsellors, and believed
them to be two of the greatest men he had ever seen or
heard of, and at the head of their profession.</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul&mdash;I hope, sir, you'll have those two
gents in <i>my</i> case?" said he, earnestly, to Gammon.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, your case will not come on in their
courts," said Gammon, with a very expressive smile.</p>

<p>"Why, can't it come on where I choose?&mdash;or when
you like?" inquired Titmouse, surprisedly.</p>

<p>Mr. Quirk had been soured during the whole of dinner,
for he had anxiously desired to have Titmouse sit beside
him at the bottom of the table; but in the little hubbub
attendant upon coming down to dinner and taking
places, Titmouse slipped out of sight for a minute; and
when all were placed, Quirk's enraged eye perceived him
seated in the middle of the table, beside Gammon. Gammon
<i>always</i> got hold of Titmouse!&mdash;Old Quirk could
have flung a decanter at his head.&mdash;In his own house!&mdash;at
his own table! Always anticipating and circumventing him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Quirk, I don't think we've taken a glass of wine
together yet, have we?" said Gammon, blandly and cordially,
at the same time pouring one out for himself. He
perfectly well knew what was annoying his respected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
partner, whose look of quaint embarrassment, when so
suddenly assailed, infinitely amused him. "Catch me
asking you here again, Master Gammon," thought Quirk,
"with Titmouse!" The reason why Mr. Snap had not
been asked was, that Quirk had some slight cause to suspect
his having presumptuously conceived the notion of
paying his addresses to Miss Quirk&mdash;a thing at any time
not particularly palatable to Mr. Quirk; but in the
present conjuncture of circumstances quite out of the
question, and intolerable even in idea. Snap was not
slow in guessing the reason of his exclusion, which had
greatly mortified, and also not a little alarmed him. As
far as he could venture, he had, during the week, endeavored
to "set" Titmouse "against" Miss Quirk, by
such faint disparaging remarks and insinuations as he
dared venture upon with so difficult a subject as Titmouse,
whom he at the same time inflamed by representations
of the splendid matches he might very soon
command among the highest women of the land. By
these means Snap had, to a certain extent, succeeded; but
the few melting glances which had fallen upon Titmouse's
sensitive bosom from the eyes of Miss Quirk, were beginning
to operate a slight change in his feelings. The old
alderman, on an intimation that the "ladies were going
to withdraw," laid violent hands on Miss Quirk, (he was
a "privileged" old fool,) and insisted on her singing his
favorite song&mdash;"<i>My Friend and Pitcher</i>"!! His request
was so warmly seconded by the rest of the company&mdash;Titmouse
loud and eager as any&mdash;that she was
fain to comply. She sang with some sweetness, and
much self-<ins title='possesssion'>possession</ins>; and carried Titmouse's feelings
along with her from the beginning, as Gammon, who
was watching him, perceived.</p>

<p>"Most uncommon lovely gal, isn't she?" whispered
Titmouse, with great vivacity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very!" replied Gammon, dryly, with a slight smile.</p>

<p>"Shall I call out <i>encore</i>? A'n't that the word? 'pon
my soul, most lovely gal! She <i>must</i> sing it again!"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;she wishes to go&mdash;'tis not usual: she
will sing it for you, I dare say, this evening, if you ask
her."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;most charming gal!&mdash;Lovely!"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have patience, my dear Titmouse," said Gammon, in
a low whisper, "in a few months' time you'll soon be
thrown into much higher life than even <i>this</i>&mdash;among
<i>really</i> beautiful, and rich, and accomplished
women"&mdash;[and, <i>thought</i> Gammon, you'll resemble a monkey that
has found his way into a rich tulip-bed!]</p>

<p>"Fancy that girl Tag-rag standing beside Miss Quirk!"
whispered Titmouse, scornfully.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" gently laughed Gammon&mdash;"both of them,
in their way, are very worthy persons; but"&mdash;Here the
ladies withdrew. 'Twas no part of Gammon's schemes,
that Titmouse should become the son-in-law of either
Quirk or Tag-rag. Mr. Gammon had formed already,
vastly different plans for him!</p>

<p>As soon as Quirk had taken the head of the table, and
the gentlemen drawn together, the bottles were pushed
round very briskly, accompanied by no fewer than three
different sorts of snuff-boxes, all belonging to Mr. Quirk&mdash;all
of them presents from grateful Old Bailey clients!
One was a huge affair, of Botany Bay wood, with a very
flaming inscription on the inside of the lid; from which
it appeared that its amiable donors, who were trying the
effect of a change of climate on their moral health at the
expense of a grateful country, owed their valuable lives
to the professional skill and exertions of "Caleb Quirk,
Esq." In short, the other two were trophies of a similar
description, of which their possessor was very justly not
a little proud; and as he saw Titmouse admiring them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
it occurred to him as very possible that, within a short
time, he should be in possession of a magnificent <i>gold</i>
snuff-box, in acknowledgment of the services he should
have rendered to his distinguished guest and client. Titmouse
was in the highest possible spirits. This, his first
glimpse into high life, equalled all his expectations.
Round and round went the bottles&mdash;crack went joke
after joke. Slang sang song upon song, of, however, so
very coarse and broad a character as infinitely disgusted
Gammon, and apparently shocked the alderman;&mdash;though
I greatly distrust that old sinner's sincerity in
the matter. Then Ghastly's performances commenced.
Poor fellow! he exerted himself to the utmost to earn
the good dinner he had just devoured; but when he
was in the very middle of one of his most impassioned
scenes&mdash;undoubtedly "tearing a passion to rags,"&mdash;Mr.
Quirk interrupted impatiently&mdash;"Come, come, Ghastly,
we've had enough of <i>that</i> sort of thing&mdash;it don't
suit&mdash;d'ye see&mdash;at all!&mdash;Lord bless us!&mdash;don't <i>roar</i> so, man!"</p>

<p>Poor Ghastly instantly resumed his seat, with a chagrined
and melancholy air.</p>

<p>"Give us something funny," snuffled the alderman.</p>

<p>"Let's have the chorus of Pigs and Ducks," said Quirk;
"you do that <i>remarkable</i> well. I could fancy the animals
were running, and squealing, and quacking all about the
room!" The actor respectfully did as he was desired,
commencing with a sigh, and was much applauded. At
length Gammon happened to get into a discussion with
Mr. Bluster upon some point connected with the Habeas
Corpus Act, in which our friend Gammon, who never got
heated in discussion, and was very accurate in whatever
he knew, had glaringly the best of it. His calm, smiling
self-possession almost drove poor Bluster frantic. The
less he knew, of course the louder he talked, the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
vehement and positive he became; at length offering a
<i>bet</i> that there was no such thing as a writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i>
before the time of Charles II.;[<a href='#Note_20'>20</a>] at which Gammon
bowed, smiled, and closed the discussion. While engaged
in it, he had of course been unable to keep his eye upon
Titmouse, who drank, consequently, claret, port, sherry,
and madeira, like a little fish, never letting the decanter
pass him. Every one about him filled his glass every time&mdash;why
should not he?</p>

<p>Hug sat next to Viper; feared him, and avoided discussion
with him; for, though they agreed in the lowest
Radical politics, they had a personal antipathy each to
the other. In spite of their wishes, they at length got
entangled in a very virulent controversy, and said so
many insulting things to each other, that the rest of the
company, who had for some time been amused, got at
length&mdash;not disgusted&mdash;but alarmed, for the possible
results&mdash;fully expecting the exchange of a brace of wine-glasses
against each other's heads! Mr. Quirk therefore interfered.</p>

<p>"Bravo! bravo! bravo!" he exclaimed, as Viper concluded
a most envenomed passage, "that will do, Viper&mdash;whip
it into the next <i>Flash</i>&mdash;'t will be a capital leader!
It will produce a sensation! And in the mean time, gentlemen,
let me request you to fill your glasses&mdash;bumpers&mdash;for
I have a toast to propose, in which you'll all feel
interested when you hear who's the subject of it. It
is a gentleman who is likely soon to be elevated to a
station which Nature has formed him&mdash;hem! hem!&mdash;to
adorn"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Quirk's proposing your health, Titmouse!" whispered
Gammon to his companion, who, having been very
restless for some time, had at length become quite silent&mdash;his
head resting on his hand, his elbow on the
table&mdash;his eyes languidly half open, and his face exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
pale. Gammon saw that he was, in truth, in an
exceedingly ticklish condition.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;wish&mdash;you'd&mdash;let me&mdash;go out&mdash;I'm devilish
ill"&mdash;said Titmouse, faintly. Gammon made a signal to
Quirk, who instantly ceased his speech; and coming down
to Titmouse, he and Gammon hastily led that gentleman
out of the room and into the nearest bed-chamber, where
he began to be very ill indeed, and so continued for several
hours. Old Quirk, who was a long-headed man, was
delighted by this occurrence; for he saw that if he insisted
on Titmouse's being put to bed, and passing the
night&mdash;and perhaps the next day&mdash;at Alibi House, it
would enable Miss Quirk to bring her attractions to bear
upon him effectively, by exhibiting those delicate and endearing
attentions which are so soothing and indeed necessary
to an invalid. Titmouse continued desperately
indisposed during the whole of the night; and, early in
the morning, it was thought advisable to send for a medical
man, who pronounced Titmouse to be in danger of a
bilious fever, and to require rest and care and medical
attendance for some days to come. This was rather "too
much of a good thing" for old Quirk; but there was no
remedy. Foreseeing that Titmouse would be thrown constantly,
for some little time to come, into Miss Quirk's
company, her prudent parent enjoined upon Mrs. Alias,
his sister, the necessity of impressing on his daughter's
mind the great uncertainty which, after all, existed as to
Titmouse's prospects; and the consequent necessity there
was for her to regulate her conduct with a view to either
failure or success&mdash;to keep her affections, as it were, in
abeyance. But the fact was, that Miss Quirk had so often
heard the subject of Titmouse's brilliant expectations
talked of by her father, and knew so well his habitual
prudence and caution, that she looked upon Titmouse's
speedy possession of ten thousand a-year as a matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
almost of certainty. She was a girl of some natural shrewdness,
but of an early inclination to maudlin sentimentality.
Had she been blest with the vigilant and affectionate care
of a mother as she grew up, (that parent having died
when Miss Quirk was but a child,) and been thrown among
a set of people different from those who constantly visited
at Alibi House&mdash;and of whom a very <i>favorable</i> specimen
has been laid before the reader&mdash;Miss Quirk might really
have become a very sensible and agreeable girl. As it
was, her manners had contracted a certain coarseness,
which at length overspread her whole character; and the
selfish and mercenary motives by which she could not
fail to perceive all her father's conduct regulated, gradually
infected herself. She resolved, therefore, to be governed
by the considerations so urgently pressed upon her
by both her father and her aunt.</p>

<p>It was several days before Titmouse was allowed, by his
medical man, to quit his bedroom; and it is impossible
for any woman not to be touched by the sight of a sudden
change effected in a man's appearance by severe indisposition
and suffering, even be that man so poor a creature
as Titmouse. He was very pale, and considerably reduced
by the serious nature of the attack, and of the
powerful treatment with which it had been encountered.
When he made his first appearance before Miss Quirk, one
afternoon, with somewhat feeble gait, and a languid air
which mitigated, if it did not obliterate, the foolish and
conceited expression of his features, she really regarded him
with something akin to interest; and, though she might
hardly have owned it even to herself, his expected good
fortune invested him with a sort of subdued radiance.
<i>Ten thousand a-year</i>!&mdash;Miss Quirk's heart fluttered! By
the time that he was well enough to take his departure,
she had, at his request, read over to him nearly half of
that truly interesting work,&mdash;the Newgate Calendar; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
had sung to him and played to him whatever he asked her;
and, in short, she felt that if she could but be certain
that he would gain his great lawsuit, and step into ten
thousand a-year, she could <i>love</i> him. She insisted, on the
day of his quitting Alibi House, that he should write in
her album; and he very readily complied. It was nearly
ten minutes before he could get a pen to suit him. At
length he succeeded, and left the following interesting memento
of himself in the very centre of a fresh page:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tittlebat Titmouse Is My name,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">England Is My Nation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">London Is My dwelling-Place,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And Christ Is My Salvation.<br /></span>
<span class="i14">"<span class="smcap">Tittlebat Titmouse</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i18">"halibi lodge."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Miss Quirk turned pale with astonishment and vexation
on seeing this elegant and striking addition to her
album. Titmouse, on the contrary, looked at it with no
little pride; for having had a capital pen, and his heart
being in his task, he had produced what he conceived to
be a very superior specimen of penmanship: in fact, the
signature was by far the best he had ever written. When
he had gone, Miss Quirk was twenty times on the point
of tearing out the leaf which had been so dismally disfigured;
but on her father coming home in the evening,
he laughed heartily&mdash;"and as to tearing it out," said he,
"let us first see which way the verdict goes!"</p>

<p>Titmouse became, after this, a pretty frequent visitor
at Alibi House; growing more and more attached to Miss
Quirk, who, however, conducted herself towards him with
much judgment. His inscription on her album had done
a vast deal towards cooling down the ardor with which
she had been disposed to regard even the future owner of
ten thousand a-year. Poor Snap seemed to have lost all
chance, being treated with greater coldness by Miss Quirk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
on every succeeding visit to Alibi House. At this he was
sorely discomfited; for she would have whatever money
her father might die possessed of, besides a commanding
interest in the partnership business. 'T&nbsp;was a difficult
thing for him to preserve his temper under such circumstances,
in his close intimacy with Titmouse, who had so
grievously interfered with his prospects.</p>

<p>The indisposition I have been mentioning, prevented
Titmouse from paying his promised visit to Satin Lodge.
On returning to his lodgings from Alibi House, he found
that Tag-rag had either called or sent every day to inquire
after him with the most affectionate anxiety; and
one or two notes lying on his table apprised him of the
lively distress which the ladies of Satin Lodge were enduring
on his account, and implored him to lose not a
moment in communicating the state of his health, and
personally assuring them of his safety. Though the image
of Miss Quirk was continually before his eyes, Titmouse,
nevertheless, had cunning enough not to drop the slightest
hint to the Tag-rags of the true state of his feelings.
Whenever any inquiry, with ill-disguised anxiety, was
made by Mrs. Tag-rag concerning Alibi House and its inmates,
Titmouse would, to be sure, mention Miss Quirk,
but in such a careless and slighting way as gave great
consolation and encouragement to Tag-rag, his wife, and
daughter. "Miss Quirk," he said, "was well enough&mdash;but
devilish fat!"&mdash;When at Mr. Quirk's, he spoke somewhat
unreservedly of the amiable inmates of Satin Lodge.
These two mansions were almost the only private residences
visited by Titmouse, who spent his time much in
the way which I have already described. How he got
through his <i>days</i> I can hardly tell. At his lodgings he
got up very late, and went to bed very late. He never
read anything excepting occasionally a song-book lent him
by Snap, or a novel, or some such book as "Boxiana," from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
the circulating library, and the <i>Sunday Flash</i>. Dawdling
over his dress and his breakfast, then whistling and humming
and looking out of the window, took up so much of
every day as he passed at his lodgings. The rest was spent
in idling about the town, looking in at shop windows, and
now and then going to some petty exhibition&mdash;as of sparring,
cock-fighting, etc. When evening came, he was
generally joined by Snap, when they would spend the
night together in the manner I have already described.
As often as he dared, he called at Messrs. Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap's office at Saffron Hill, worrying them not a
little by inquiries concerning the state of his affairs, and
the cause of the delay in commencing proceedings. As
for Huckaback, by the way, Titmouse cut him entirely;
saying that he was a devilish low fellow, and it was no
use knowing him. He made many desperate efforts, both
personally and by letter, to renew his acquaintance with
Titmouse, but in vain. I may as well mention, by the
way, that as soon as Snap got scent of the little money
transaction between his friend and Huckaback, he called
upon the latter, and tendering him twelve shillings, demanded
up the document which he had extorted from
Titmouse. Huckaback held out obstinately for some time&mdash;but
Snap was too much for him, and talked in such a
formidable strain about an indictment for a conspiracy (!)
and fraud, that Huckaback at length consented, on receiving
twelve shillings, to deliver up the document to Snap,
on condition of Snap's destroying it on the spot. This was
done, and so ended all intercourse&mdash;at least on this side
of the grave&mdash;between Titmouse (as far, at least, as <i>his</i>
intentions went) and Huckaback.</p>

<p>The sum allowed by Messrs. Quirk and Gammon to Titmouse,
was amply sufficient to have kept him in comfort;
but it never would have enabled him to lead the kind of
life which I have described&mdash;and he would certainly have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
got very awkwardly involved, had it not been for the kindness
of Snap in advancing him, from time to time, such
sums as his exigencies required. In fact, matters went
on as quietly and smoothly as possible for several months&mdash;till
about the middle of November; when an event occurred
which seemed to threaten the total demolition of
all his hopes and expectations.</p>

<p>He had not seen or heard from Messrs. Quirk or Gammon
for nearly a fortnight; Snap he had not seen for
nearly a week. At length he ventured to make his appearance
at Saffron Hill, and was received with a startling
coldness&mdash;a stern abruptness of manner&mdash;which
frightened him out of his wits. All the three partners
were alike&mdash;as for Snap, the contrast between his present
and his former manner, was perfectly shocking: he
seemed quite another person. The fact was, that the full
statement of Titmouse's claims had been laid before Mr.
Subtle, the leading counsel retained in his behalf, for his
opinion on the case generally, before actually commencing
proceedings; and the partners were indeed thunderstruck
on receiving that opinion; for Mr. Subtle pointed out a
radical deficiency of proof in a matter which, as soon as
their attention was thus pointedly called to it, Messrs.
Quirk and Gammon were amazed at their having overlooked,
and still more at its having escaped the notice of
Mr. Tresayle, Mr. Mortmain, and Mr. Frankpledge. Mr.
Quirk hurried with the opinion to the first two of these
gentlemen; and after a long interview with each, they
owned their fears that Mr. Subtle was right, and that the
defect seemed incurable; but they easily satisfied their
agitated clients, that <i>they</i>&mdash;the aforesaid Messrs. Tresayle
and Mortmain&mdash;had been guilty of neither oversight nor
ignorance, inasmuch as the matter in question was one of
<i>evidence</i> only&mdash;one which a <i>nisi prius</i> lawyer, with a full
detail of "proofs" before him, could hardly fail to light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
upon&mdash;but which, it would be found, had been <i>assumed</i>,
and <i>taken for granted</i>, in the cases laid before conveyancers.
They promised, however, to turn it over in
their minds, and to let Messrs. Quirk and Gammon know
if anything occurred to vary their impression. A week
elapsed, however, and Mr. Tresayle and Mr. Mortmain
preserved an ominous silence. As for Frankpledge, he
had a knack, somehow or another, of always coming to
the conclusion wished and hoped for by his clients; and,
after prodigious pains, he wrote a very long opinion, to
show that there was nothing in the objection. Neither
Mr. Quirk nor Mr. Gammon could understand the process
by which Mr. Frankpledge arrived at such a result; but,
in despair, they laid his opinion before Mr. Subtle, in the
shape of a further "Case for his Opinion." It was in a
few days' time returned to them, with only a line or two&mdash;thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I see no reason whatever to depart from the view I have
already taken of this case.&mdash;J. S."</p></div>

<p>Here was something like a dead lock, indeed!</p>

<p>"We're <i>done</i>, Gammon!" said Quirk, with a dismayed
air. Gammon seemed lost, and made no answer.</p>

<p>"Does anything&mdash;eh?" quoth Quirk, with a troubled
air. "<i>Any</i>thing occur to you? Gammon, I <i>will</i> say this
for you&mdash;you're a long-headed fellow!" Still Gammon
spoke not.</p>

<p>"Gammon! Gammon! I really believe&mdash;ah?&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;begin
to see something&mdash;don't you?"</p>

<p>"<i>It's to be</i> <span class="smcap">done</span>, Mr. Quirk!" said Gammon, at length,
with a grave and apprehensive look, and a cheek which
had suddenly grown pale.</p>

<p>"Eh? how? Oh, I see!&mdash;Know what you mean, Gammon,"
replied Quirk, with a hurried whisper, glancing at
both doors to see that they were safe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>"We must resume our intercourse with Titmouse, and
let matters go on as before," said Gammon, with a very
anxious, but, at the same time, a determined air.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wonder if what has occurred to <i>you</i> is what has
occurred to me?" inquired Quirk, in an eager whisper.</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh! Mr. Quirk."</p>

<p>"Gammon, dear Gammon, no mystery! You know I
have a very deep stake in this matter!"</p>

<p>"So have I, Mr. Quirk," replied Gammon, with a sigh.
"However"&mdash;Here the partners put their heads close
together, and whispered to each other in a low, earnest
tone, for some minutes. Quirk rose from his seat, and
took two or three turns about the room in silence, Gammon
watching him calmly.</p>

<p>To his inexpressible relief and joy, within a few hours
of the happening of the above colloquy, Titmouse found
himself placed on precisely his former footing with
Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap.</p>

<p>In order to bring on the cause for trial at the next
spring assizes, it was necessary that the declaration in
ejectment should be served on the tenant in possession
before Hilary term; and, in a matter of such magnitude,
it was deemed expedient that Snap should proceed to
Yorkshire, and personally effect the service in question.
In consequence, also, of some very important suggestions
as to the evidence, given by the junior in the cause, (Mr.
Lynx,) it was arranged that Snap should go down about
a week before the time fixed upon for effecting the service,
and make quietly certain minute inquiries in the neighborhood
of Yatton. As soon as Titmouse had heard of this
movement&mdash;that Snap was going direct to Yatton, the
scene of his, Titmouse's, future greatness&mdash;he made the
most pertinacious and vehement entreaties to Messrs.
Quirk and Gammon to be allowed to accompany him, even
going down on his knees. There was no resisting this;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
but they exacted from him a solemn pledge that he would
place himself entirely at the disposal of Mr. Snap; go
under some feigned name, and, in short, neither say nor
do anything tending to disclose their real character or errand.</p>

<p>Snap and Titmouse established themselves at the Hare
and Hounds Inn at Grilston; and the former immediately
began, cautiously and quietly, to collect such evidence as
he could discover. One of the first persons to whom he
went was old Blind Bess. His many pressing questions
at length stirred up in the old woman's mind faint confused
recollections of long-forgotten names, persons, places,
scenes, and associations, thereby producing an agitation
not easily to be got rid of, and which had by no means
subsided when Dr. Tatham and Mr. Aubrey paid her the
Christmas-day visit, which has been described.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>
<hr class='chapter' />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<p>The reader has had, already, pretty distinct indications of
the manner in which Titmouse and Snap conducted themselves
during their stay in Yorkshire; and which, I fear,
have not tended to raise either of these gentlemen in the
reader's estimation. Titmouse manifested a very natural
anxiety to see the present occupants of Yatton; and it
was with infinite difficulty that Snap could prevent him
from sneaking about in the immediate neighborhood of the
Hall, with the hope of seeing them. His first encounter
with Mr. and Miss Aubrey was entirely accidental, as the
reader may remember; and when he found that the lady
on horseback near Yatton, and the lady whom he had
striven to attract the notice of in Hyde Park, were one
and the same beautiful woman, and that that beautiful
woman was neither more nor less than the sister of
the present owner of Yatton&mdash;the marvellous discovery
created a mighty pother in his little feelings. The blaze
of Kate Aubrey's beauty in an instant consumed the images
both of Tabitha Tag-rag and Dora Quirk. It even
for a while outshone the splendors of ten thousand a-year:
such is the inexpressible and incalculable power of
woman's beauty over everything in the shape of man&mdash;over
even so despicable a sample of him, as Tittlebat Titmouse.</p>

<p>While putting in practice some of those abominable
tricks to which, under Snap's tutelage, Titmouse had
become accustomed in walking the streets of London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
and from which even the rough handling they had got
from farmer Hazel could not turn him, Titmouse at
length, as has been seen, most unwittingly fell foul of
that fair creature, Catherine Aubrey herself; who seemed
truly like an angelic messenger, returning from her errand
of sympathy and mercy, and suddenly beset by a
little imp of darkness. When Titmouse discovered who
was the object of his audacious and revolting advances,
his soul (such as it was) seemed petrified within him; and
it was fortunate that the shriek of Miss Aubrey's attendant
at length startled him into a recollection of a pair of
heels, to which he was that evening indebted for an escape
from a most murderous cudgelling, which might have been
attended with one effect not contemplated by him who
inflicted it, (so profoundly in the dark are we as to the
causes and consequences of human actions;) viz. the retention
of the Aubreys in the possession of Yatton! Titmouse
ran for nearly half a mile on the high-road towards
Grilston, without stopping. He dared not venture to return
to Yatton, with the sound of the lusty farmer's voice
in his ears, to get back from the Aubrey Arms the horse
which had brought him that afternoon from Grilston, to
which place, therefore, he walked on, through the snow
and darkness; reaching his inn in a perfect panic, from
which, at length, a tumbler of stiff brandy and water, with
two or three cigars, somewhat relieved him. Forgetful
of the solemn pledge which he had given to Messrs. Quirk,
Gammon, and Snap, not to disclose his name or errand,
and it never once occurring to him that if he would but
keep his own counsel, Miss Aubrey could never identify
<i>him</i> with the ruffian who had assailed her; Titmouse spent
the interval between eight and twelve o'clock, at which
latter hour the coach by which he had resolved to return
to London would pass through Grilston, in inditing the
following letter to Miss Aubrey:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>This exquisitely constructed document its accomplished
writer sealed twice, and then left, together with sixpence,
in the hands of the landlady of the Hare and Hounds, to
be delivered at Yatton Hall the first thing in the morning.
The good woman, however&mdash;having no particular
wish to oblige such a strange puppy, whom she was only
too glad to get rid of, and having moreover a good deal to
attend to&mdash;laid the letter aside on the chimney-piece, and
entirely lost sight of it for nearly a fortnight. Shortly
after the lamentable tidings concerning the impending misfortunes
of the Aubrey family had been communicated to
the inhabitants of Grilston, she forwarded the letter, (little
dreaming of the character in which its writer was likely,
erelong, to reappear at Grilston,) together with one or two
others, a day or two after Miss Aubrey had had the interview
with her brother which I have described to the
reader; but it lay unnoticed by any one&mdash;above all, by
the sweet sufferer whose name was indicated on it&mdash;among
a great number of miscellaneous letters and papers which
had been suffered to accumulate on the library table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey entered the library one morning, alone, for
the purpose of attending to many matters which had been
long neglected. He was evidently thinner: his face was
pale, and his manner dejected: still there was about him
an air of calmness and resolution. Through the richly-pictured
old stained-glass window, the mottled sunbeams
were streaming in a kind of tender radiance upon the dear
familiar objects around him. All was silent. Having
drawn his chair to the table, on which was lying a confused
heap of letters and papers, he felt a momentary repugnance
to enter upon the task which he had assigned
to himself; and rose and walked slowly for some time up
and down the room, with folded arms, uttering occasionally
profound sighs. At length he resumed his seat, and
commenced the disheartening task of opening the many
letters before him. One of the earliest that came to his
hand was from Peter Johnson&mdash;the old tenant to whom
he had lent the sum of two hundred pounds, and it was
full of fervent expressions of gratitude and respect; Mr.
Aubrey's heart ached as he read them. Then came a letter,
a fortnight old, bearing the frank of Lord C&mdash;&mdash;, the
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. He opened it and read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='sigr' style='margin-left:2em;'>"<i>Whitehall, 16th January, 18&mdash;.</i></p>

<p>"My <span class="smcap">dear Aubrey</span>,</p>

<p>"You will remember that Lord &mdash;&mdash;'s motion stands for the
28th. We all venture to calculate upon receiving your powerful
support in the debate. We expect to be much pressed with
the Duke of &mdash;&mdash;'s affair, which you handled shortly before the
recess with such signal ability and success. When you return
to town, you must expect a renewal of certain offers, which I
most sincerely trust, for the benefit of the public service, will
not be <i>again</i> declined.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey laid down the letter calmly, as soon as he
had read it; and leaning back in his chair, seemed lost
in thought for several minutes. Presently he reapplied
himself to his task, and opened and glanced over a great
many letters; the contents of several of which occasioned
him deep emotion. Some were from persons in distress
whom he had assisted, and who implored a continuance
of his aid; others were from ardent political friends&mdash;some
sanguine, others desponding&mdash;concerning the prospects
of the session. Two or three hinted that it was
everywhere reported that he had been offered one of the
under secretaryships, and had declined; but that it was,
at the king's desire, to be pressed upon him. Many letters
were on private, and still more on county, business;
and with one of them he was engaged when a servant
entered with one of that morning's county newspapers.
Tired with his task, Mr. Aubrey rose from his chair as
the servant gave him the paper; and, standing before
the fire, unfolded the <i>Yorkshire Stingo</i>, and glanced listlessly
over its miscellaneous contents. At length his eye
lit upon the following paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The rumors so deeply affecting a member for a certain
borough in this county, and to which we alluded in our last
paper but one, turn out to be well founded. A claimant has
started up to the very large estates at present held by the gentleman
in question; and we are much misinformed if the ensuing
spring assizes will not effect a considerable change in the
representation of the borough alluded to, by relieving it from
the Tory thraldom under which it has been so long oppressed.
We have no wish to bear hard upon a falling man; and, therefore,
shall make no comment upon the state of mind in which
that person may be presumed to be, who must be conscious of
having been so long enjoying the just rights of others. Some
extraordinary disclosures may be looked for when the trial
comes on. We have heard from a quarter on which we are
disposed to place reliance, that the claimant is a gentleman of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
decided Whig principles, and who will prove a valuable accession
to the Liberal cause."[<a href='#Note_21'>21</a>]</p></div>

<p>Mr. Aubrey was certainly somewhat shocked by brutality
such as this; but on Miss Aubrey's entering the
room, he quietly folded up the paper and laid it aside,
fearful lest his sister's feelings should be pierced by the
coarse and cruel paragraph which it contained. It had,
in fact, been concocted in London, in the office of Messrs.
Quirk, Gammon, and Snap; who were, as before stated,
interested in the <i>Sunday Flash</i>, which was in some sort
connected, through the relationship of the editors, with
the <i>Yorkshire Stingo</i>. The idea had been suggested by
Gammon, by way of attempting to enlist the <i>political</i>
feeling of a portion of the county, in favor of their client.</p>

<p>"Here are several letters for <i>you</i>, Kate," said her
brother, picking out several of them. The very first she
took up, it having attracted her attention by the double
seal, and the vulgar style of the handwriting, was that
from Titmouse, which has just been laid before the reader.
With much surprise she opened the letter, her brother
being similarly engaged with his own; and her face getting
gradually paler and paler as she went on, at length
she flung it on the floor with a passionate air, and burst
into tears. Her brother, with astonishment, exclaimed&mdash;"Dear
Kate, what is it?" and he rose and stooped to pick
up the letter.</p>

<p>"Don't&mdash;don't, Charles!" she cried, putting her foot
upon it, and flinging her arms round his neck. "It is an
audacious letter&mdash;a vulgar, a cruel letter, dear Charles!"
Her emotion increased as her thoughts recurred to the
heartless paragraph concerning her brother with which
the letter concluded. "I could have overlooked everything
but <i>that</i>," said she, unwittingly. With gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
force he succeeded in getting hold of the painfully ridiculous
and contemptible effusion. He attempted faintly to
smile several times as he went on.</p>

<p>"Don't&mdash;don't, dearest Charles!" said she, passionately.
"I can't bear it!&mdash;Don't smile!&mdash;It's very
far from your heart; you do it only to assure <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>Here Mr. Aubrey read the paragraph concerning himself.
His face turned a little paler than before, and his
lips quivered with suppressed emotion. "He is evidently
a <i>very</i> foolish fellow!" he exclaimed, walking towards the
window, with his back to his sister, whom he did not
wish to see how much he was affected by so petty an incident.</p>

<p>"What does he allude to, Kate, when he talks of your
having spoken angrily to him, and that he did not know
you?" he inquired, after a few moments' pause, returning
to her.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!&mdash;I am so <i>grieved</i> that you should have
noticed it&mdash;but since you ask I will not deceive you!"
and she told him the disgusting occurrence alluded to in
the letter. Mr. Aubrey drew himself up unconsciously as
Kate went on, and she perceived him becoming still
paler than before, and <i>felt</i> the kindling anger of his eye.</p>

<p>"Forget it&mdash;forget it, dearest Charles!&mdash;So despicable
a being is really not worth a thought," said Kate,
with increasing anxiety; for she had never in her life
before witnessed her brother the subject of such powerful
emotions as then made rigid his slender frame. At length
drawing a long breath&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is fortunate for him, Kate," said he, calmly, "that
<i>he</i> is not a gentleman, and that I <i>endeavor to be</i>&mdash;a
Christian." She flung her arms round him, exclaiming,
"There spoke my own noble brother!"</p>

<p>"I shall preserve this letter as a curiosity, Kate," said
he, presently, and with a faint smile, and a pointed significance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
of manner, which arrested his sister's attention, he
added,&mdash;"It is rather singular, but some time before
you came in, I opened a letter in which your name is
mentioned&mdash;I cannot say in a <i>similar</i> manner, and
yet&mdash;in short, it is from Lord De la Zouch, enclosing one"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Miss Aubrey suddenly blushed scarlet, and trembled violently.</p>

<p>"Don't be agitated, my dear Kate, the enclosure is
from Lady De la Zouch; and if it be in the same strain
of kindness that pervades Lord De la Zouch's letter to <i>me</i>"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I would rather that <i>you</i> opened and read it, Charles"&mdash;she
faltered, sinking into a chair.</p>

<p>"Come, come, dear Kate&mdash;play the woman!" said
her brother, with an affectionate air&mdash;"To say that
there is nothing in these letters that I believe will interest
you&mdash;very deeply gratify and interest your feelings&mdash;would be"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;suspect&mdash;I"&mdash;&mdash; faltered Miss
Aubrey, with much agitation&mdash;"I shall return."</p>

<p>"Then you shall take these letters with you, and read,
or not read them, as you like," said her brother, putting
them into her hand with a fond and sorrowful smile,
which soon, however, flitted away&mdash;and, leading her
to the door, he was once more alone; and, after a brief
interval of revery, he wrote answers to such of the many
letters before him as he considered earliest to require them.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the judgment and tenderness with
which Dr. Tatham discharged the very serious duty which,
at the entreaty of his afflicted friends, he had undertaken,
of breaking to Mrs. Aubrey the calamity with which she
and her family were menaced, the effects of the disclosure
had been most disastrous. They occasioned an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
attack of paralysis; and Mr. Aubrey, who had long been
awaiting the issue, in sickening suspense, in an adjoining
room, was hastily summoned in to behold a mournful and
heart-rending spectacle. His venerable mother&mdash;she
who had given him life, at the mortal peril of her own;
she whom he cherished with unutterable tenderness and
reverence; she who doted upon him as upon the light of
her eyes; from whose dear lips he had never heard a word
of unkindness or severity; whose heart had never known
an impulse but of gentle, noble, unbounded generosity
towards all around her&mdash;this idolized being now lay
suddenly prostrated and blighted before him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Poor Aubrey yielded to his long and violent agony,
in the presence of her who could apparently no longer
hear or see, or be sensible of what was passing in the chamber.</p>

<p>"My son," said Dr. Tatham, after the first burst of
his friend's grief was over, and he knelt down beside his
mother with her hand grasped in his, "despise not the
chastening of the Lord; neither be weary of his correction:</p>

<p>"For whom the Lord loveth, he correcteth, even as a
father the son in whom he delighteth.</p>

<p>"The Lord will not cast off forever;</p>

<p>"But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion
according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>

<p>"For he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children
of men."</p>

<p>It was with great difficulty that Dr. Tatham could render
himself audible while uttering these soothing and
solemn passages of Scripture in the ear of his distracted
friend, beside whom he knelt.</p>

<p>Mrs. Aubrey had suffered a paralytic seizure, and lay
motionless and insensible; her features slightly disfigured,
but partially concealed beneath her long silvery gray hair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
which had, in the suddenness of the fit, strayed from
beneath her cap.</p>

<p>"But what am I about?" at length exclaimed Mr. Aubrey,
with a languid and alarmed air&mdash;"has medical assistance"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dr. Goddart and Mr. Whately are both sent for by
several servants, and will doubtless be very quickly here,"
replied Dr. Tatham; and while he yet spoke, Mr. Whately&mdash;who,
when hastened on by the servant who had been
sent for him, was entering the park on a visit to young
Mrs. Aubrey, who was also seriously ill and in peculiarly
critical circumstances&mdash;entered the room, and immediately
resorted to the necessary measures. Soon afterwards,
also, Dr. Goddart arrived; but alas, how little
could they do for the venerable sufferer!</p>

<p>During the next, and for many ensuing days, the lodge
was assailed by very many anxious and sympathizing inquirers,
who were answered by Waters, whom Mr. Aubrey&mdash;oppressed
by the number of friends who hurried up to
the Hall, and insisted upon seeing him to ascertain the
extent to which the dreadful rumors were correct&mdash;had
stationed there during the day to afford the requisite information.
The Hall was pervaded by a gloom which
could be <i>felt</i>. Every servant had a woe-begone look, and
moved about as if a funeral were stirring. Little Charles
and Agnes, almost imprisoned in their nursery, seemed
quite puzzled and confused at the strange unusual seriousness,
and quietness, and melancholy faces everywhere
about them. Kate romped not with them as had been
her wont; but would constantly burst into tears as she
held them on her knee or in her arms, trying to evade
the continual questioning of Charles. "I think it will be
time for <i>me</i> to cry too, by-and-by!" said he to her one
day, with an air half in jest and half in earnest, that made
poor Kate's tears flow afresh. Sleepless nights and days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
of sorrow soon told upon her appearance. Her glorious
buoyancy of spirits, which erewhile, as it were, had filled
the whole Hall with gladness&mdash;where were they now?
Ah, me! the rich bloom had disappeared from her beautiful
cheek; but her high spirit, though oppressed, was not
broken, and she stood firmly and calmly amid the scowling
skies and lowering tempests. You fancied you saw
her auburn tresses stirred upon her pale but calm brow
by the breath of the approaching storm; and that she
also felt it, but trembled not, gazing on it with a bright
and steadfast eye. Her <i>heart</i> might be, indeed, bruised
and shaken; but her <i>spirit</i> was, ay, unconquerable. My
glorious Kate, how my heart goes forth towards you!</p>

<p>And thou, her brother, who art of kindred spirit; who
art supported by philosophy, and exalted by religion, so
that thy constancy cannot be shaken or overthrown by
the black and ominous swell of trouble which is increasing
and closing around thee, I know that thou wilt outlive
the storm&mdash;and yet it rocks thee!</p>

<p>A month or two may see thee and thine expelled from
Old Yatton, and not merely having lost everything, but
with a liability to thy successor which will hang round
thy neck like a millstone. What, indeed, is to become
of you all? Whither will you go? And your suffering
mother, should she indeed survive so long, is her precious
form to be borne away from Yatton?</p>

<p>Around thee stand those who, if thou fallest, will perish&mdash;and
that thou knowest; around thy calm, sorrowful,
but erect figure, are a melancholy group&mdash;thy afflicted
mother&mdash;the wife of thy bosom&mdash;thy two little children&mdash;thy
brave and beautiful sister&mdash;Yet think not, Misfortune!
that over this man thou art about to achieve thy
accustomed triumphs. Here, behold, thou hast a <span class="smcap">man</span> to
contend with; nay, more, a <span class="smcap">Christian man</span>, who hath
calmly girded up his loins against the coming fight!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<p>'Twas Sabbath evening, some five weeks or so after the
happening of the mournful events above commemorated,
and Kate, having spent, as usual, several hours keeping
watch beside the silent and motionless figure of her
mother, had quitted the chamber for a brief interval,
thinking to relieve her oppressed spirits by walking, for
a little while, up and down the long gallery. Having
slowly paced backwards and forwards once or twice, she
rested against the little oriel window at the farthest extremity
of the gallery, and gazed with saddened eye upon
the setting sun, till at length, in calm grandeur, it disappeared
beneath the horizon. 'Twas to Kate a solemn and
mournful sign; especially followed as it was by the deepening
shadows and gloom of evening. She sighed, and
with her hands crossed on her bosom, gazed, with a tearful
eye, into the darkening sky, where glittered the brilliant
evening star. Thus she remained, a thousand pensive and
tender thoughts passing through her mind, till the increasing
chills of evening warned her to retire. "I will go,"
said she to herself, as she walked slowly along, "and try
to play the evening hymn&mdash;I may not have <i>many</i> more
opportunities!" With this view, she gently opened the
drawing-room door, and, glancing around, found that she
should be alone. The fire gave the only light. She
opened the organ with a sigh, and then sat down before
it for some minutes without touching the keys. At length
she struck them very gently, as if fearful of disturbing
those who, she soon recollected, were too distant to hear
her. Ah! how many associations were stirred up as she
played over the simple and solemn air! At length, in a
low and rather tremulous voice, she began&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Soon will the evening star, with silver ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shed its mild radiance o'er the sacred day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resume we, then, ere night and silence reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rites which holiness and heaven ordain"&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></div></div>

<p>She sang the last line somewhat indistinctly; and, overcome
by a flood of tender recollections, ceased playing;
then, leaning her head upon her hand, she shed tears. At
length she resumed&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here humbly let us hope our Maker's smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will crown with sweet success our earthly toil&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here, on each returning Sabbath, join"&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here poor Kate's voice quivered&mdash;and after one or two
ineffectual attempts to sing the next line, she sobbed, and
ceased playing. She remained for several minutes, her
face buried in her handkerchief, shedding tears. At
length, "I'll play the last verse," thought she, "and
then sit down before the fire, and read over the evening
service," (feeling for her little prayer-book,) "before I return
to poor mamma!" With a firmer hand and voice
she proceeded&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Father of Heaven! in whom our hopes confide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose power defends us, and whose precepts guide&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In life our guardian, and in death our friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glory supreme be thine, till time shall end."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She played and sang these lines with a kind of solemn
energy; and she felt as if a ray of heavenly light had
trembled for a moment upon her upturned eye. She had
not been, as she had supposed, alone; in the farthest
corner of the room had been all the while sitting her
brother&mdash;too exquisitely touched by the simplicity and
goodness of his sweet sister, to apprise her of his presence.
Several times his feelings had nearly overpowered him;
and as she concluded, he arose from his chair, and
approaching her, after her first surprise was over,&mdash;"Heaven
bless you, dear Kate!" said he, taking her
hands in his own. Neither of them spoke for a few moments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<p>"I could not have sung a line, or played, if I had
known that you were here," said she, tremulously.</p>

<p>"I thought so, Kate, and therefore I remained silent"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't think I shall ever have heart to play again!"
she replied&mdash;they were both silent.</p>

<p>"Be assured, Kate, that submission to the will of God,"
said Mr. Aubrey, as (he with his arm round his sister)
they walked slowly to and fro, "is the great lesson to be
learned from the troubles of life; and for that purpose
they are sent. Let us bear up awhile; the waters will
not go over our heads!"</p>

<p>"I hope not," replied his sister, faintly, and in tears.
"How did you leave Agnes, Charles?"</p>

<p>"She was asleep; she is still very feeble"&mdash;&mdash; Here
the door was suddenly opened, and Miss Aubrey's maid
entered hastily, exclaiming, "Are you here, ma'am?&mdash;or sir?"</p>

<p>"Here we are," they replied, hurrying towards her;
"what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Madam is <i>talking</i>! She began speaking all of a
sudden. She did, indeed, sir. She's talking, and"&mdash;&mdash; continued
the girl, almost breathless.</p>

<p>"My mother talking!" exclaimed Aubrey, with an
amazed air.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir! she is&mdash;she is, indeed!"</p>

<p>Miss Aubrey sank into her brother's arms, overcome for
a moment with the sudden and surprising intelligence.</p>

<p>"Rouse yourself, Kate!" he exclaimed with animation;
"did I not tell you that Heaven would not forget us?
But I must hasten up-stairs, to hear the joyful sounds
with my own ears&mdash;and do you follow as soon as you
can." Leaving her in the care of her maid, he hastened
out of the room, and was soon at the door of his mother's
chamber. He stood for a moment in the doorway, and
his straining ears caught the gentle tones of his mother's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
voice, speaking in a low but cheerful tone. His knees
trembled beneath him with joyful excitement. Fearful
of trusting himself in her presence till he had become
calmer, he noiselessly sank on the nearest chair, with beating
heart and straining ear&mdash;ay, every tone of that dear
voice thrilled through his heart. But I shall not torture
myself or my reader by dwelling upon the scene which
ensued. Alas! the venerable sufferer's tongue was indeed
loosed;&mdash;but reason had fled! He listened&mdash;he distinguished
her words. She supposed that all her children&mdash;dead
and alive&mdash;were romping about her; she spoke
of him and his sister as she had spoken to them twenty
years ago!</p>

<p>As soon as he had made this woful discovery, overwhelmed
with grief, he staggered out of the room; and
motioning his sister, who was entering, into an adjoining
apartment, communicated to her, with great agitation, the
lamentable condition of their mother.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<p>The chief corner-stone suddenly found wanting in the
glittering fabric of Mr. Titmouse's fortune, so that, to the
eyes of its startled architects, Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and
Snap, it seemed momentarily threatening to tumble about
their ears, was a certain piece of evidence which, being a
matter-of-fact man, I should like to explain to the reader,
before we get on any farther. In order, however, to do
this effectually, I must go back to an earlier period in the
history than has been yet called to his attention. I make
no doubt, that by the superficial and impatient <i>novel</i>-reader,
certain portions of what has gone before, and which
could not fail of attracting the attention of long-headed
people, as not likely to have been thrown in for nothing,
(and therefore requiring to be borne in mind with a view
to subsequent explanation,) have been entirely overlooked
or forgotten. However this may be, I can fancy that the
sort of reader whom I have in my eye, as one whose curiosity
it is worth some pains to excite, and sustain, has
more than once asked himself the following question, viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>How did Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, first come
to be acquainted with the precarious tenure by which Mr.
Aubrey held the Yatton property?&mdash;Why, it chanced in
this wise.</p>

<p>Mr. Parkinson of Grilston, who has been already introduced
to the reader, had succeeded to his father's first-rate
business as a country attorney and solicitor in Yorkshire.
He was a highly honorable, painstaking man, and deservedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
enjoyed the entire confidence of all his numerous
and influential clients. Some twelve years before the period
at which this history commences, he had, from pure
kindness, taken into his service an orphan boy of the
name of Steggars, at first merely as a sort of errand-boy,
and to look after the office. He soon, however, displayed
so much sharpness, and acquitted himself so creditably
in anything that he happened to be concerned in, a little
above the run of his ordinary duties, that in the course
of a year or two he became a sort of clerk, and sat and
wrote at the desk it had formerly been his sole province to
dust. Higher and higher did he rise, in process of time,
in his master's estimation; and at length became quite a
<i>factotum</i>&mdash;as such, acquainted with the whole course of
business that passed through the office. Many interesting
matters connected with the circumstances and connections
of the neighboring nobility and gentry were thus
constantly brought under his notice, and now and then
set him thinking whether the knowledge thus acquired
could not, in some way, and at some time or another, be
turned to his own advantage; for I am sorry to say that
he was utterly unworthy of the kindness and confidence
of Mr. Parkinson, who little thought that in Steggars he
had to deal with&mdash;a rogue in grain. Such being his character,
and such his opportunities, this worthy had long
made a practice of minuting down, from time to time,
anything of interest or importance in the affairs of his betrayed
master's clients&mdash;even laboriously copying long
documents, when he thought them of importance enough
for his purpose, and had the opportunity of doing so without
attracting the attention of Mr. Parkinson. He thus
silently acquired a mass of information which might have
enabled him to occasion great annoyance, and even inflict
serious injury; and the precise object he had in view, was
either to force himself, hereafter, into partnership with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
employer, (provided he could get regularly introduced into
the profession,) or even compel his master's clients to receive
him into their confidence, adversely to Mr. Parkinson;
and make it worth his while to keep the secrets of
which he had become possessed. So careful ought to be,
and indeed generally are, attorneys and solicitors, as to
the characters of those whom they thus receive into their
employ. On the occasion of Mr. Aubrey's intended marriage
with Miss St. Clair, with a view to the very liberal
settlements which he contemplated, a full "Abstract" of
his "Title" was laid by Mr. Parkinson before his conveyancer,
in order to advise, and to prepare the necessary
instruments. Owing to inquiries suggested by the conveyancer,
additional statements were laid before him; and
produced an opinion of a somewhat unsatisfactory description,
from which I shall lay before the reader the following paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"...There seems no reason for supposing that any descendant
of Stephen Dreddlington is now in existence;[<a href='#Note_22'>22</a>] still, <i>as
it is by no means physically impossible that such a person may be
in esse</i>, it would unquestionably be most important to the
security of Mr. Aubrey's title, to establish clearly the validity
of the conveyance by way of mortgage, executed by Harry
Dreddlington, and which was afterwards assigned to Geoffrey
Dreddlington on his paying off the money borrowed by his deceased
uncle; since the descent of Mr. Aubrey from Geoffrey
Dreddlington would, in that event, clothe him with an indefeasible
title at law, by virtue of that deed; and any equitable
rights which were originally outstanding, would be barred by
lapse of time. But the difficulty occurring to my mind on this
part of the case is, that unless Harry Dreddlington, who executed
that deed of mortgage, survived his father, (a point on
which I am surprised that I am furnished with no information,)
the deed itself would have been mere waste parchment,
as in reality the conveyance of a person who <i>never had any interest</i>
in the Yatton property&mdash;and, of course, neither Geoffrey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
Dreddlington, nor his descendant, Mr. Aubrey, could derive
any right whatever under such an instrument. In that case,
such a contingency as I have above hinted at&mdash;I mean
the existence of any legitimate descendant of Stephen
Dreddlington&mdash;<i>might have a most serious effect upon the rights of
Mr. Aubrey</i>."</p></div>

<p>Now every line of this opinion, and also even of the Abstract
of Title upon which it was written, did this quicksighted
young scoundrel copy out, and deposit, as a great
prize, in his desk, among other similar notes and memoranda,&mdash;little
wotting his master, the while, of what
his clerk was doing. Some year or two afterwards, the
relationship subsisting between Mr. Parkinson and his
clerk Steggars, was suddenly determined by a somewhat
untoward event; viz. by the latter's decamping with the
sum of £700 sterling, being the amount of money due on
a mortgage which he had been sent to receive from a client
of Mr. Parkinson's. Steggars fled for it&mdash;but first
having bethought himself of the documents to which I
have been alluding, and which he carried with him to
London. Hot pursuit was made after the enterprising
Mr. Steggars, who was taken into custody two or three
days after his arrival in town, while he was walking about
the streets, with the whole of the sum which he had embezzled,
<i>minus</i> a few pounds, upon his person, in bank-notes.
He was quickly deposited in Newgate. His natural
sagacity assured him that his case was rather an ugly
one; but hope did not desert him.</p>

<p>"Well, my kiddy," said Grasp, the grim-visaged, gray-headed
turnkey, as soon as he had ushered Steggars into
his snug little quarters; "here you are, you see&mdash;isn't you?"</p>

<p>"I think I am," replied Steggars, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;and if you want to have a chance of not going
across the water afore your time, you'll get yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
<i>defended</i>, and the sooner the better, d'ye see. There's
<i>Quirk</i>, <i>Gammon</i>, and <i>Snap</i>&mdash;my eyes! how they <i>do</i> thin
this here place of ours, to be sure! The only thing is to
get 'em soon; 'cause, ye see, they're so run after. Shall
I send them to you?"</p>

<p>Steggars answered eagerly in the affirmative. In order
to account for this spontaneous good-nature on the part
of Grasp, I must explain that old Mr. Quirk had for years
secured a highly respectable criminal practice, by having
in his interest most of the officers attached to the police-offices
and Newgate. He gave, in fact, systematic gratuities
to these gentry, in order to get their recommendations
to the persecuted individuals who came into their
power. Very shortly after Grasp's messenger had reached
Saffron Hill, with the intelligence that "there was <i>something
new in the trap</i>," old Quirk bustled down to Newgate,
and was introduced to Steggars, with whom he was
closeted for some time. He took a lively interest in his
new client, to whose narrative of his flight and capture
he listened in a very kind and sympathizing way, lamenting
the severity of the late statute applicable to the
case;[<a href='#Note_23'>23</a>] and promised to do for him whatever his little
skill and experience <i>could</i> do. He hinted however, that,
as Mr. Steggars must be aware, a <i>little</i> ready money would
be required, in order to fee counsel&mdash;whereat Steggars
looked very dismal indeed, and knowing the state of his
exchequer, imagined himself already on shipboard, on
his way to Botany Bay. Old Mr. Quirk asked him if he
had no friends who would raise a trifle for a "chum in
trouble,"&mdash;and on Mr. Steggars answering in the negative,
he observed the enthusiasm of the respectable old
gentleman visibly and rapidly cooling down.</p>

<p>"But I'll tell you what, sir," said poor Steggars, suddenly,
"if I haven't money, I may have <i>money's worth</i> at
my command;&mdash;I've a little box, that's at my lodging,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
which those that catched me knew nothing of&mdash;and in
which there is a trifle or two about the families and fortunes
of some of the first folk in the best part of Yorkshire,
that would be precious well worth looking after, to
those who know how to follow up such matters."</p>

<p>Old Quirk hereat pricked up his ears, and asked his
young friend how he got possessed of such secrets.</p>

<p>"Oh fie! fie!" said he, gently, as soon as Steggars had
told him the practices of which I have already put the
reader in possession.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;you may say fie! fie! if you like," quoth Steggars,
earnestly; "but the thing is, not how they were
come by, but what can be done with them, now they're
got. For example, there's a certain member of parliament
in Yorkshire, that, high as he may hold his head,
has no more right to the estates that yield him a good
ten thousand a-year than I have, but keeps some folk out
of their own, that could pay some other folk a round sum
to be put in the way of getting their own;" and that&mdash;intimated
the suffering captive&mdash;was only <i>one</i> of the good
things he knew of. Here old Quirk rubbed his chin,
hemmed, fidgeted about in his seat, took off his glasses,
wiped them, replaced them; and presently went through
that ceremony again. He then said that he had had
the honor of being concerned for a great number of gentlemen
in Mr. Steggars' "present embarrassed circumstances,"
but who had always been able to command at
least a five-pound note, at starting, to run a heat for liberty.</p>

<p>"Come, come, old gentleman," quoth Steggars, earnestly,
"I don't want to go over the water before my
time, if I can help it, I assure you; and I see you know
the value of what I've got! Such a gentleman as you
can turn every bit of paper I have in my box into a
fifty-pound note."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>"All this is moonshine, my young friend," said old
Quirk, in an irresolute tone and manner.</p>

<p>"Ah! is it, though? To be able to tell the owner of
a fat ten thousand a-year, that you can spring a mine
under his feet at any moment&mdash;eh?&mdash;and no one ever
know how you came by your knowledge. And if they
wouldn't do what was handsome, couldn't you <i>get the
right heir</i>&mdash;and wouldn't <i>that</i>&mdash;Lord! it would make
the fortunes of half-a-dozen of the first houses in the
profession!" Old Quirk got a little excited.</p>

<p>"But mind, sir&mdash;you see"&mdash;said Steggars, "if I get
off, I'm not to be cut out of the thing altogether&mdash;eh?
I shall look to be taken into your employ, and dealt handsomely by"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh Lord!" exclaimed Quirk, involuntarily&mdash;adding
quickly, "Yes, yes! to be sure! only fair; but let us
first get you out of your present difficulty, you know!"
Steggars, having first exacted from him a written promise
to use his utmost exertions on his (Steggars') behalf, and
secure him the services of two of the most eminent Old
Bailey counsel&mdash;viz. Mr. Bluster and Mr. Slang&mdash;gave
Mr. Quirk the number of the house where the precious
box was, and a written order to the landlord to deliver
it up to the bearer: after which Mr. Quirk shook him
cordially by the hand, and having quitted the prison,
made his way straight to the house in question, and succeeded
in obtaining what he asked for. He faithfully
performed his agreement, with Steggars; for he retained
both Bluster and Slang for him, and got up their briefs
with care: but, alas! although these eminent men exerted
all their great powers, they succeeded not in either
bothering the judge, bamboozling the jury, or browbeating
the witnesses, (the principal one of whom was Mr.
Parkinson;) Steggars was found guilty and sentenced to
be transported for fourteen years.[<a href='#Note_24'>24</a>] Enraged at this issue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
he sent a message the next day to Mr. Quirk, requesting
a visit from him. When he arrived, Steggars, in a very
violent tone, demanded that his papers should be returned
to him. 'Twas in vain that Mr. Quirk explained
to him again and again his interesting position with reference
to his goods, chattels, and effects&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> that, as
a convicted felon, he had no further concern with them,
and might dismiss all anxiety on that score from his
mind. Steggars hereat got more furious than before,
and intimated plainly the course he should feel it his
duty to pursue&mdash;viz. that, if the papers in question
were not given up to him as he desired, he should at
once write off to his late employer, Mr. Parkinson, and
acknowledge how much more he (Steggars) had wronged
that gentleman and his clients, than he supposed of. Old
Quirk very feelingly represented to him that he was at
liberty to do anything that he thought calculated to relieve
his excited feelings: and then Mr. Quirk took a final
farewell of his client, wishing him health and happiness.</p>

<p>"I say, Grasp!" said he, in a whisper, to that grim
functionary, as soon as he had secured poor Steggars in
his cell, "that bird is a little ruffled just now&mdash;isn't
he, think you?"</p>

<p>"Lud, sir, that's the nat'ralist thing in the world, considering"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if he should want a letter taken to any one,
whatever he may say to the contrary, you'll send it on
to Saffron Hill&mdash;eh? Understand?&mdash;He may be injuring
himself, you know;" and old Quirk with one hand
clasped the huge arm of Grasp in a familiar way, and
with the forefinger of the other touched his own nose,
and then winked his eye.</p>

<p>"All right!" quoth Grasp, and they parted. Within
a very few hours' time, Mr. Quirk received, by the hand
of a trusty messenger, from Grasp, a letter written by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
Steggars to Mr. Parkinson; a long and eloquent letter,
to the purport and effect which Steggars had intimated.
Mr. Quirk read it with much satisfaction, for it disclosed
a truly penitent feeling, and a desire to undo as much
mischief as the writer had done. He (Mr. Quirk) was
not in the least exasperated by certain very plain terms
in which his own name was mentioned; but making all
due allowances, quietly put the letter in the fire as
soon as he had read it. In due time Mr. Steggars, whose
health had suffered from close confinement, caught frequent
whiffs of the fresh sea-breeze, having set out, under
most favorable auspices, for Botany Bay; to which distant
but happy place, he had been thus fortunate in early securing
an "<i>appointment</i>" for so considerable a portion of
his life.</p>

<p>Such, then, were the miserable means by which Mr.
Quirk became acquainted with the exact state of Mr.
Aubrey's title; on first becoming apprised of which,
Mr. Gammon either felt, or affected, great repugnance
to taking any part in the affair. He appeared to suffer
himself, at length, however, to be over-persuaded by
Quirk into acquiescence; and, that point gained&mdash;having
ends in view of which Mr. Quirk had not the least
conception, and which, in fact, had but suddenly occurred
to Mr. Gammon himself&mdash;worked his materials with a
caution, skill, energy, and perseverance, which soon led
to important results. Guided by the suggestions of acute
and experienced counsel, after much pains and considerable
expense, they had succeeded in discovering that
precious specimen of humanity, Tittlebat Titmouse, who
hath already figured so prominently in this history. When
they came to set down on paper the result of all their
researches and inquiries, in order to submit it in the shape
of a case for the opinion of Mr. Mortmain and Mr. Frankpledge,
in the manner described in a former part of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
history, it looked perfect <i>on paper</i>, as many a faulty pedigree
and abstract of title had looked before, and will yet
look. It was quite possible for even Mr. Tresayle himself
to overlook the defect which had been pointed out
by Mr. Subtle. That which is stated to a conveyancer,
as <i>a fact</i>&mdash;any particular event, for instance, as of a
death, a birth, or a marriage, at a particular time or
place, which the very nature of the case renders highly
probable&mdash;he is warranted in assuming to be so. But
when the same statement comes&mdash;with quite a different
object&mdash;under the experienced eye of a <i>nisi prius</i> lawyer,
who knows that he will have to <i>prove</i> his case, step
by step, the aspect of things is soon changed. "De non
<i>apparentibus</i>, et de non <i>existentibus</i>," saith the law, "eadem
est ratio." The first practitioner in the common law,
before whom the case came, in its roughest and earliest
form, in order that he might "lick it into shape," and
"advise generally" preparatory to its "being laid before
counsel," was Mr. Traverse, a young pleader, whom
Messrs. Quirk and Gammon were disposed to take by the
hand. He wrote a very showy, but superficial and
delusive opinion; and put the intended <i>protégé</i> of his
clients, as it were by a kind of hop, step, and jump, into
possession of the Yatton estates. Quirk was quite delighted
on reading it; but Gammon shook his head with
a somewhat sarcastic smile, and said he would at once
prepare a case for the opinion of Mr. Lynx, whom he had
pitched upon as the junior counsel in any proceedings
which might be instituted in a court of law. Lynx (of
whom I shall speak hereafter) was an experienced, hard-headed,
vigilant, and accurate lawyer; the very man for
such a case, requiring, as it did, most patient and minute
examination. With an eye fitted</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To inspect a mite, not comprehend the heaven,"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span></div></div>

<p>he <i>crawled</i>, as it were, over a case; and thus, even as
one can imagine that a beetle creeping over the floor of
St. Paul's, would detect minute flaws and fissures invisible
to the eye of Sir Christopher Wren himself, spied out
defects which much nobler optics would have overlooked.
To come to plain matter-of-fact, however, I have beside
me the original opinion written by Mr. Lynx; and shall
treat the reader to a taste of it&mdash;giving him sufficient to
enable him to appreciate the very ticklish position of
affairs with Mr. Titmouse. To make it not altogether
unintelligible, let us suppose the state of the pedigree to
be something like this, (as far as concerns our present purpose:)&mdash;</p>

<p class='center'>
<img src='images/pg441.png' style='width:450px' alt='family tree' title='family tree' />
</p>

<p>Be pleased now, unlearned reader, to bear in mind that
"<i>Dreddlington</i>" at the top of the above table, is the common
ancestor, having two sons, the elder "<i>Harry Dreddlington</i>,"
the younger "<i>Charles Dreddlington</i>;" the latter
having, in like manner, two sons, "<i>Stephen Dreddlington</i>"
the elder son, and "<i>Geoffrey Dreddlington</i>" the younger
son; that Mr. Aubrey, at present in possession, claims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
under "<i>Geoffrey Dreddlington</i>." Now it will be incumbent
on Mr. Titmouse, in the first instance, to establish in
himself a clear, independent, legal, and possessory title
to the estates; it being sufficient for Mr. Aubrey, (possession
being nine-tenths of the law), to falsify Titmouse's
proofs, or show them defective&mdash;"because," saith a very
learned sergeant, who hath writ a text-book upon the
Action of Ejectment, "the plaintiff in an action of ejectment
must recover upon the strength of his own title, not
the weakness of his adversary's."[<a href='#Note_25'>25</a>]</p>

<p>Now, <i>rebus sic stantibus</i>, behold the astute Lynx advising
(inter alia) in manner following; that is to say&mdash;</p>

<p>"It appears clear that the lessor of the plaintiff (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
Tittlebat Titmouse) will be able to prove that Dreddlington
(the common ancestor) was seised of the estate at
Yatton in the year 1740; that he had two sons, Harry
and Charles, the former of whom, after a life of dissipation,
appears to have died without issue; and that from
the latter (Charles) are descended Stephen, the ancestor
of the lessor of the plaintiff, and Geoffrey, the ancestor of
the defendant. Assuming, therefore, that the descent of
the lessor of the plaintiff from Stephen can be made out,
as there appears every reason to expect, [on this point
Lynx had written two brief pages,] a clear <i>primâ facie</i>
case will have been established on the part of the lessor
of the plaintiff. As, however, it is suspected that Harry
Dreddlington executed a conveyance in fee of the property,
in order to secure the loan contracted by him from
Aaron Moses, it will be extremely important to ascertain,
and, if possible, procure satisfactory evidence that the decease
of Harry Dreddlington occurred before the period at
which, by his father's death, that conveyance could have
become operative upon the property: since it is obvious
that, should he have survived his father, <i>that instrument,
being outstanding</i>, may form a complete answer to the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
of the lessor of the plaintiff.[<a href='#Note_26'>26</a>] The danger will be obviously
increased should the debt to Aaron Moses prove to
have been paid off, (as it is stated was rumored to have
been the fact,) by Geoffrey Dreddlington, the younger son
of Charles Dreddlington; for, should that turn out to be
the case, he would probably have taken a conveyance to
himself, or to trustees for his benefit, from Aaron Moses&mdash;which
being in the power of the defendant, Mr. Aubrey,
would enable him to make out a title to the property,
paramount to that now attempted to be set up on behalf of
Mr. Titmouse. Every possible exertion, therefore, should
be made to ascertain the precise period of the death of
Harry Dreddlington. The registries of the various parishes
in which the family may have at any time resided
should be carefully searched; and an examination made
in the churches and churchyards, of all tombstones, escutcheons,
etc., belonging, or supposed to belong, to the
Dreddlington family, and by which any light can be thrown
upon this most important point. It appears clear that
Dreddlington (the common ancestor) died on the 7th August,
1742:&mdash;the question, therefore, simply is, <i>whether
the death of his eldest son (Harry) took place prior or subsequent
to that period</i>. It is to be feared that the defendant
may be in possession of some better and more direct evidence
on this point than is attainable by the lessor of the
plaintiff. The natural presumption would certainly seem
to be that the son, being the younger and stronger man,
was the survivor."[<a href='#Note_27'>27</a>]</p>

<p>The above-mentioned opinion of Mr. Lynx, together
with that of Mr. Subtle entirely corroborating it, (and
which was alluded to in a late chapter of this history,[<a href='#Note_28'>28</a>])
and a pedigree, were lying on the table, one day, at the
office at Saffron Hill, before the anxious and perplexed
partners, Messrs. Quirk and Gammon.</p>

<p>Gammon was looking attentively, and with a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
chagrined air, at the pedigree; and Quirk was looking
at Gammon.</p>

<p>"Now, Gammon," said the former, "just let me see
again where the exact hitch is&mdash;eh? You'll think
me perhaps infernally stupid, but&mdash;curse me if I can
see it!"</p>

<p>"See it, my dear sir? Here, <i>here</i>!" replied Gammon,
with sudden impatience, putting his finger two or three
times to the words "<i>Harry D.</i>"</p>

<p>"Lord bless us! Don't be so sharp with one, Gammon!
I know as well as you that that's <i>about</i> where
the crack is; but what is the precise thing we're in want
of, eh?"</p>

<p>"Proof, my dear sir," replied Gammon, somewhat impatiently,
but with a smile, "of the death of Harry Dreddlington
some time&mdash;no matter when&mdash;previous to the
7th August, 1742; and in default thereof, Mr. Quirk, we
are all flat on our backs, and had better never have stirred
in the business!"</p>

<p>"You know, Gammon, you're better <i>up</i> in these matters
than I&mdash;(because I've not been able to turn my
particular attention to 'em since I first began business)&mdash;so
just tell me, in a word, what good's to be got by showing
that fellow to have died in his father's lifetime?"</p>

<p>"You don't show your usual acuteness, Mr. Quirk,"
replied Gammon, blandly. "It is to make waste paper of
that confounded conveyance which he executed, and which
Mr. Aubrey doubtless has, and with which he may, at a
stroke, cut the ground from under our feet!"</p>

<p>"The very thought makes one feel quite funny&mdash;don't
it, Gammon?" quoth Quirk, with a flustered air.</p>

<p>"It may well do so, Mr. Quirk. Now we <i>are</i> fairly
embarked in a cause where success will be attended
with so many splendid results, Mr. Quirk&mdash;though I'm
sure you'll always bear me out in saying how very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
unwilling I was to take advantage of the villany of that
miscreant Steg&mdash;hem"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gammon, Gammon, you're always harking back to
that&mdash;I'm tired of hearing on't!" interrupted Quirk,
angrily, but with an embarrassed air.</p>

<p>"Well, now we're in it," said Gammon, with a sigh,
and shrugging his shoulders, "I don't see why we should
allow ourselves to be baffled by trifles. The plain question
is, undoubtedly, whether we are to stand still&mdash;<i>or
go on</i>." Mr. Quirk gazed at Mr. Gammon with an anxious
and puzzled look.</p>

<p>"How d'ye make out&mdash;in a legal way, you know,
Gammon&mdash;<i>when</i> a man died&mdash;I mean, of a <i>natural</i> death?"
somewhat mysteriously inquired Quirk, who was familiar
enough with the means of proving the exact hour of certain
<i>violent</i> deaths at Debtor's Door.</p>

<p>"Oh! there are various methods of doing so, my dear
sir," replied Gammon, carelessly. "Entries in family
Bibles and prayer-books&mdash;registers&mdash;tombstones&mdash;ay,
by the way, <span class="smcap">an old tombstone</span>," continued Gammon,
musingly, "that would settle the business!"</p>

<p>"An old tombstone!" echoed Quirk, briskly, but suddenly
dropping his voice. "Lord, Gammon, so it would!
That's an <i>idea</i>!&mdash;I call that a decided idea, Gammon.
'Twould be the very thing!"</p>

<p>"The very thing!" repeated Gammon, pointedly.
They remained silent for some moments.</p>

<p>"Snap could not have looked about him sharply enough
when he was down at Yatton&mdash;could he, Gammon?" at
length observed Quirk, in a low tone, flushing all over as
he uttered the last words, and felt Gammon's cold gray
eye settled on him like that of a snake.</p>

<p>"He could not, indeed, my dear sir," replied Gammon,
while Quirk continued gazing earnestly at him, now and
then wriggling about in his chair, rubbing his chin, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
drumming with his fingers on the table.&mdash;"And now
that you've suggested the thing, [oh, Gammon!
Gammon]&mdash;it's not to be wondered at!&mdash;You know, it
would have been an old tombstone&mdash;a sort of fragment
of a tombstone, perhaps&mdash;so deeply sunk in the ground,
probably, as easily to have escaped observation. Eh?&mdash;Does
not it strike <i>you</i> so, Mr. Quirk?" All this was said
by Gammon in a musing manner, and in a very low tone
of voice; and he was delighted to find his words sinking
into the eager and fertile mind of his companion.</p>

<p>"Ah, Gammon!" exclaimed Quirk, with a sound of
partly a sigh, and partly a whistle, (the former being the
exponent of the <i>true</i> state of his feelings, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> anxiety&mdash;the
latter of what he wished to <i>appear</i> the state of his
feelings, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> indifference.)</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Quirk?"</p>

<p>"You're a deep devil, Gammon&mdash;I <i>will</i> say that for
you!" replied Quirk, glancing towards each door, and,
as it were, unconsciously drawing his chair a little closer
to that of Gammon.</p>

<p>"Nay, my dear sir!" said Gammon, with a deferential
and deprecating smile, "you give me credit for an acuteness
I feel I do not possess! If, indeed, I had not had
<i>your</i> sagacity to rely upon, ever since I have had the
honor of being connected with you in business&mdash;&mdash; ah,
Mr. Quirk, you know you lead&mdash;I follow"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gammon, Gammon!" interrupted Quirk, with an
uncomfortable, but still a mollified air, "Come&mdash;your
name's <i>Oily</i>"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"In moments like these, Mr. Quirk, I say nothing that
I do not feel," interrupted Gammon, gravely, putting to
his nose the least modicum of snuff which he could take
with the tip of his finger out of the huge box of Mr.
Quirk, who, just then, was thrusting immense pinches,
every half minute, up his nostrils.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>"It will cost a great deal of money to find that same
tombstone, Gammon!" said Quirk, in almost a whisper,
and paused, looking intently at Gammon.</p>

<p>"I think this is a different kind of snuff from that
which you usually take, Mr. Quirk, isn't it?" inquired
Gammon, as he inserted the tips of his fingers a second
time into the mechanically proffered box of Mr. Quirk.</p>

<p>"The same&mdash;the same," replied Quirk, hastily.</p>

<p>"You are a man better fitted for serious emergencies,
Mr. Quirk, than any man I ever came near," said Gammon,
deferentially; "I perceive that you have hit the
nail on the head, as indeed you <i>always</i> do!"</p>

<p>"Tut! Stuff, Gammon; you're every bit as good a
hand as I am!" replied Quirk, with an evident mixture
of pleasure and embarrassment. Gammon smiled, shook
his head, and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"'Tis that practical sagacity of yours, Mr. Quirk," said
Gammon&mdash;"you know it as well as I can tell you&mdash;that
has raised you to your present professional eminence!"
He paused, and looked very sincerely at his senior partner.</p>

<p>"Well, I must own I think I <i>do</i> know a trick or two,"
quoth Quirk, with a sort of <i>grunt</i> of gratification.</p>

<p>"Ay, and further, there are <i>some</i> clever men who never
can keep their own counsel; but are like a hen that has
just laid an egg, and directly she has risen, goes foolishly
cackling about everywhere, and then her egg is taken
away; but <i>you</i>"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Quirk; "that's <i>devilish</i> good,
Gammon!&mdash;Capital! Gad, I think I see the hen! Ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" echoed Gammon, gently. "But to be serious,
Mr. Quirk; what I was going to say was, that I thoroughly
appreciate your admirable caution in not confiding to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
one&mdash;no, not even to me&mdash;the exact means by which
you intend to extricate us from our present dilemma."
Here Quirk got very fidgety, and twirled his watch-key violently.</p>

<p>"Hem! But&mdash;hem! Ay&mdash;a&mdash;a," he grunted, looking
with an uneasy air at his calm astute companion;
"I didn't mean so much as all <i>that</i>, either, Gammon;
for two heads, in my opinion, are better than one. You
<i>must</i> own that, Gammon!" said he, not at all relishing
the heavy burden of responsibility which he felt that
Gammon was about to devolve upon his (Quirk's) shoulders exclusively.</p>

<p>"'Tis undoubtedly rather a serious business on which
we are now entering," said Gammon; "and I have always
admired a saying which you years ago told me of that
great man Machiavel"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>[Oh, Gammon! Gammon! You well know that poor
old Mr. Quirk never heard of the name of that same
Machiavel till this moment!]&mdash;</p>

<p>"That 'when great affairs are stirring, a master-move
should be confined to the master-mind that projects it.'
I understand! I see! I will not, therefore, inquire into
the precise means by which I am satisfied you will make
it appear, in due time (while I am engaged getting up the
subordinate, but very harassing details of the general
case), that <i>Harry Dreddlington died</i> <span class="smcap">before</span> <i>the 7th of
August, 1742</i>." Here, taking out his watch, he suddenly
added&mdash;"Bless me, Mr. Quirk, how time passes!&mdash;Two
o'clock! I ought to have been at Messrs. Gregson's a
quarter of an hour ago."</p>

<p>"Stop&mdash;a moment or two can't signify! It&mdash;it,"
said Quirk, hesitatingly, "it was <i>you</i>, wasn't it, that
thought of the tombstone?"</p>

<p>"I, my dear Mr. Quirk"&mdash;interrupted Gammon, with
a look of astonishment and deference.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, come&mdash;honor among thieves, you know, Gammon!"
said Quirk, trying to laugh.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;it shall never be said that I attempted to take
the credit of"&mdash;&mdash; commenced Gammon; when a clerk
entering, put an end to the colloquy between the partners,
each of whom, presently, was sitting alone in his own
room&mdash;for Gammon found that he was too late to think
of keeping his engagement with Messrs. Gregson; if indeed
he had ever made any&mdash;which, in fact, he had <i>not</i>.
Mr. Quirk sat in a musing posture for nearly half an hour
after he and Gammon had separated. "Gammon <i>is</i> a
deep one! I'll be shot if ever there was his equal," said
Quirk to himself, at length; and starting off his chair,
with his hands crossed behind him, he walked softly to
and fro. "I know what he's driving at&mdash;though he
thought I didn't! He'd let me scratch my hands in
getting the blackberries, and then he'd come smiling in
to eat 'em! But&mdash;share and share alike&mdash;share profit,
share danger, master Gammon;&mdash;you may find that
Caleb Quirk is a match for Oily Gammon&mdash;I'll have
you in for it, one way or another!" Here occurred a
long pause in his thoughts, "Really I doubt the thing's
growing unmanageable&mdash;the prize can't be worth the
risk!&mdash;<i>Risk</i>, indeed&mdash;'fore gad&mdash;it's neither more nor
less than"&mdash;&mdash; Here a certain picture hanging, covered
with black crape, in the drawing-room at Alibi House,
seemed to have glided down from its station, and to be
hanging close before his eyes, with the crape drawn aside&mdash;a
ghastly object&mdash;- eugh! He shuddered, and involuntarily
closed his eyes. "How devilish odd that I should
just <i>now</i> have happened to think of it!" he inwardly exclaimed,
sinking into his chair in a sort of cold sweat.</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n the picture!" at length said he aloud&mdash;getting
more and more flustered&mdash;"I'll burn it! It sha'n't disgrace
my drawing-room any longer!" Here Quirk almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
fancied that some busy little fiend sat squatting before the
grisly picture, writing the words "<span class="smcap">Caleb Quirk</span>" at the
bottom of it; and a sort of sickness came over him for a
moment. Presently he started up, and took down one
of several well-worn dingy-looking books standing on the
shelves&mdash;a volume of Burns' Justice. Resuming his seat,
he put on his glasses, and with a little trepidation turned
to the head "Forgery," and glanced over it, divided as it
was into two great heads&mdash;"Forgery at <i>Common Law</i>,
and Forgery <i>by Statute</i>," with many able observations of
the learned compiler, and important "<i>cases</i>" cited. At
length his eye lit upon a paragraph which seemed suddenly
to draw his heart up into his throat, producing a
sensation which made him involuntarily clap his hand
upon his neck.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gammon!!" he muttered, drawing off his glasses,
sinking back in his chair, and looking towards the door
which opened into Gammon's room; extending at the
same time, in that direction, his right arm, and shaking
his fist. "You <i>precious</i> villain!&mdash;I've an uncommon
inclination," at length thought he, "to go down slap
to Yorkshire&mdash;say nothing to anybody&mdash;make peace
with the enemy, and knock up the whole thing!&mdash;For a
couple of thousand pounds&mdash;a trifle to the Aubreys, I'm
sure. Were <i>I</i> in his place, I shouldn't grudge it; and
why should he?&mdash;By Jove," he got a little heated&mdash;"that
<i>would</i> be, as Gammon has it, a master-move! and
confined, egad! to the master-mind that thought of it!&mdash;Why
should he ever know of the way in which the
thing blew up?&mdash;Really, 'twould be worth half the
money to <i>do</i> Gammon so hollow for once&mdash;by George it
would!&mdash;Gammon, that would slip Caleb Quirk's neck
so slyly into the halter, indeed!"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, Mr. Quirk," said Gammon, suddenly
re-entering the room after about an hour's absence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
during which he too had, like his senior partner, been revolving
many things in his mind&mdash;"it has occurred to me,
that I had better immediately go down to Yatton, <i>alone</i>."</p>

<p>Hereat Mr. Quirk opened both his eyes and his mouth
to their very widest; got very red in the face; and stared
at his placid partner with a mingled expression of fear
and wonder. "Hang me, Gammon!" at length he exclaimed
desperately, slapping his fist upon the table&mdash;"if
I don't think you're the very devil himself!"&mdash;and
he sank back in his chair, verily believing, in the momentary
confusion of his thoughts, that what had been passing
through his mind was known to Gammon; or that
what had been passing through his (Quirk's) mind, had
also been occurring to Gammon, who had resolved upon
being beforehand in putting his purposes into execution.
Gammon was at first completely confounded by Quirk's
reception of him, and stood for a few moments, with his
hands elevated, in silence. Then he approached the table,
and his eye caught the well-thumbed volume of Burns'
Justice, open at the head
"<img src='images/forgery.png' style='width:100px;vertical-align:middle'
alt='FORGERY!' title='FORGERY!' />"
and the
quicksighted Gammon saw how matters stood at a glance&mdash;the
process by which the result he had just witnessed
had been arrived at.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Quirk, what new vagary now?" he inquired
with an air of smiling curiosity.</p>

<p>"Vagary be&mdash;&mdash;!" growled old Quirk, sullenly, without
moving in his chair.</p>

<p>Gammon stood for a moment or two eying him with a
keen scrutiny. "What!" at length he inquired good-humoredly,
"do you then really grudge me any share in
the little enterprise?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" quickly interrupted Quirk, pricking up his
ears. "Do you intend to play <i>Mackivel</i>! eh? What
must you go down alone to Yatton for, Gammon?"
continued Quirk, anxiously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, simply as a sort of pioneer&mdash;to reconnoitre
the churchyard&mdash;eh? I thought it might have been
of service; but if"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gammon, Gammon, your hand! I understand," replied
Quirk, evidently vastly relieved&mdash;most cordially
shaking the cold hand of Gammon.</p>

<p>"But understand, Mr. Quirk," said he, in a very peremptory
manner, "no one upon earth is to know of my
visit to Yatton except yourself."</p>

<p>He received a solemn pledge to that effect; and presently
the partners separated, a little better satisfied with
each other. Though not a word passed between them for
several days afterwards on the topic chiefly discussed during
the interview above described, the reader may easily
imagine that neither of them dropped it from his thoughts.
Mr. Quirk, shortly afterwards, paid one or two visits to the
neighborhood of Houndsditch, (a perfect hotbed of clients
to the firm,) where resided two or three gentlemen of the
Jewish persuasion, who had been placed, from time to time,
under considerable obligations by the firm of Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap, in respect of professional services rendered
both to themselves and to their friends. One of them, in
particular, had a painful consciousness that it was in old
Mr. Quirk's power at any time by a whisper to place his&mdash;the
aforesaid Israelite's&mdash;neck in an unsightly noose
which every now and then might be seen dangling from a
beam opposite Debtor's Door, Newgate, about eight o'clock
in the morning; him, therefore, every consideration of interest
and of gratitude combined to render subservient to
the reasonable wishes of Mr. Quirk. He was a most ingenious
little fellow, and had a great taste for the imitative arts&mdash;so
strong in fact, that it had once or twice placed him
in some jeopardy with the Goths and Vandals of the law;
who characterized the noble art in which he excelled, by
a very ugly and formidable word, and annexed the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
barbarous penalties to its practice. What passed between
him and old Quirk on the occasion of their interviews,
I know not; but one afternoon, the latter, on returning
to his office, without saying anything to anybody, having
bolted the door, took out of his pocket several little pieces
of paper, containing pretty little picturesque devices of
a fragmentary character, with antique letters and figures
on them&mdash;crumbling pieces of stone, some looking more
and some less sunk in the ground, and overgrown with
grass; possibly they were designs for ornaments to be
added to that tasteful structure, Alibi House&mdash;possibly
intended to grace Miss Quirk's album. However this
might be, after he had looked at them, and carefully compared
them one with another, for some time, he folded
them up in a sheet of paper, sealed it&mdash;with certainly
not the steadiest hand in the world&mdash;and then deposited
it in an iron safe.</p>

<p>Yatton, the recovery of which was the object of these
secret and formidable movements and preparations, not
to say machinations, was all this while the scene of deep
affliction. The lamentable condition of his mother plunged
Mr. Aubrey, his wife, and sister, into profounder grief than
had been occasioned by the calamity which menaced them
all in common. Had he been alone, he would have encountered
the sudden storm of adversity with unshrinking,
nay, cheerful firmness; but could it be so, when he
had ever before him those whose ruin was involved in
his own?&mdash;Poor Mrs. Aubrey, his wife, having been two
or three weeks confined to her bed, during which time
certain fond hopes of her husband had been blighted,
was almost overpowered, when, languid and feeble, supported
by Mr. Aubrey and Kate, she first entered the
bedroom of the venerable sufferer. What a difference, indeed,
was there between the appearance of all of them at
that moment, and on the Christmas day when, a happy
group, they were cheerfully enjoying the festivities of the
season! Kate was now pale, and somewhat thinner; her
beautiful features exhibited a careworn expression; yet
there was a serene lustre in her blue eye, and a composed
resolution in her air, which bespoke the superiority of her
soul. What had it not cost her to bear with any semblance
of self-possession, or fortitude, the sad spectacle
now presented by her mother! What a tender and
vigilant nurse was she, to one who could no longer
be sensible of, or appreciate her attentions! How that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
sweet girl humored all her venerated and suffering parent's
little eccentricities and occasional excitement, and
accommodated herself to every varying phasis of her mental
malady! She had so schooled her sensibilities and feelings,
as to be able to maintain perfect cheerfulness and
composure in her mother's presence, on occasions which
forced her brother to turn aside with an eye of agony&mdash;overcome
by some touching speech or wayward action of
the unconscious sufferer, who constantly imagined herself,
poor soul! to be living over again her early married life;
and that in her little grandchildren she beheld Mr. Aubrey
and Kate as in their childhood! She would gently chide
Mr. Aubrey, her husband, for his prolonged absence, asking
many times a day whether he had returned from London.
Every morning old Jacob Jones was shown into her chamber,
at the hour at which he had been accustomed, in
happier days, to attend upon her. The faithful old man's
eyes would be blinded with tears, and his voice choked,
as he was asked how Peggy got over her yesterday's journey;
and listened to questions, messages, and directions,
which had been familiar to him twenty years before, about
villagers and tenants who had long lain mouldering in
their humble graves&mdash;their way thither cheered and
smoothed by Mrs. Aubrey's Christian charity and benevolence!
'Twas a touching sight to see her two beautiful
grandchildren, in whose company she delighted,
brought, with a timorous and half-reluctant air, into
her presence. How strange must have seemed to them
the cheerfulness of the motionless figure always lying in
the bed; a cheerfulness which, though gentle as gentle
could be, yet sufficed not to assure the little things, or
set them at their ease. Though her mild features ever
smiled upon them, still 'twas from a prostrate figure, which
never moved, and was always surrounded by mournful persons,
with sorrowful constraint in their countenances and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
gestures! Charles would stand watching her, with apprehensive
eye&mdash;the finger of one hand raised to his lip,
while his other retained the hand which had brought him
in, as if fearful of its quitting hold of him; the few words
he could be brought to speak were in a subdued tone and
hurried utterance;&mdash;and when, having been lifted up to
kiss his grandmamma, he and his sister were taken out of
the chamber, their little breasts would heave a sigh which
showed how sensibly they were relieved from their recent constraint!</p>

<p>How wofully changed was everything in the once cheerful
old Hall! Mr. Aubrey sitting in the library, intently
engaged upon books and papers&mdash;Mrs. Aubrey and Kate
now and then, arm in arm, walking slowly up and down
the galleries, or one of the rooms, or the hall, not with
their former sprightly gayety, but pensive, and often in
tears, and then returning to the chamber of their suffering
parent. All this was sad work, indeed, and seemed,
as it were, to herald coming desolation!</p>

<p>But little variation occurred, for several weeks, in the
condition of Mrs. Aubrey, except that she grew visibly
feebler. One morning, however, about six weeks after
her seizure, from certain symptoms, the medical men
intimated their opinion that some important change was
on the eve of taking place, for which they prepared the
family. She had been very restless during the night.
After frequent intervals of uneasy sleep, she would awake
with evident surprise and bewilderment. Sometimes a
peculiar smile would flit over her emaciated features;
at others, they would be overcast with gloom, and she
would seem struggling to suppress tears. Her voice, too,
when she spoke, was feeble and tremulous; and she would
sigh, and shake her head mournfully. Old Jacob Jones,
not being introduced at the accustomed hour, she asked
for him. When he made his appearance, she gazed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
him for a moment or two, with a perplexed eye, exclaiming,
"Jacob! Jacob! is it you?" in a very low tone;
and then she closed her eyes, apparently falling asleep.
Thus passed the day; her daughter and daughter-in-law
sitting on either side of the bed, where they had so long
kept their anxious and affectionate vigils&mdash;Mr. Aubrey
sitting at the foot of the bed&mdash;and Dr. Goddart and Mr.
Whately in frequent attendance. Towards the evening,
Dr. Tatham also, as had been his daily custom through
her illness, appeared, and in a low tone read over the
service for the visitation of the sick. Shortly afterwards
Mr. Aubrey was obliged to quit the chamber, in order to
attend to some very pressing matters of business; and he
had been engaged for nearly an hour, intending almost
every moment to return to his mother's chamber, when
Dr. Tatham entered, as Mr. Aubrey was subscribing his
name to a letter, and, with a little earnestness, said&mdash;"Come,
my friend, let us return to your mother; methinks
she is on the eve of some decisive change: the
issue is with God!" Within a very few moments they
were both at the bedside of Mrs. Aubrey. A large chamber-lamp,
standing on a table at the farther end of the
room, diffused a soft light, rendering visible at a
glance the silent and sad group collected round the bed,
all with their eyes directed towards the venerable figure
who lay upon it. Mr. Aubrey sat beside his wife close to
his mother; and taking her white emaciated hand into
his own, gently raised it to his lips. She seemed dozing:
but his action appeared to rouse her for a moment.
Presently she fixed her eye upon him&mdash;its expression,
the while, slowly but perceptibly changing, and exciting
strange feelings within him. He trembled, and removed
not his eye from hers. He turned very pale&mdash;for the
whole expression of his mother's countenance, which was
turned full towards him, was changing. Through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
clouded windows of the falling fabric, behold! its long-imprisoned
tenant, <span class="smcap">the soul</span>, had arisen from its torpor,
and was looking at him. Reason was re-appearing. It
was, indeed, his mother, and <i>in her right mind</i>, that was
gazing at him. He scarcely breathed. At length surprise
and apprehension yielded before a gush of tenderness and
love. With what an unutterable look was his mother at
that moment regarding him! His lip quivered&mdash;his
eye overflowed&mdash;and, as he felt her fingers very gently
compressing his own, his tears fell down. Gently leaning
forward, he kissed her cheek, and sank on one knee beside
the bed.</p>

<p>"Is it you, my son?" said she, in a very low tone, but
in <i>her own</i> voice, and it stirred up instantly a thousand
fond recollections, almost overpowering him. He kissed
her hand with fervent energy, but spoke not. She continued
gazing at him with mingled solemnity and fondness.
Her eye seemed brightening as it remained fixed
upon him. Again she spoke, in a very low but clear
voice&mdash;every thrilling word being heard by all around
her: "Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden
bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain,
or the wheel broken at the cistern,&mdash;Then shall the dust
return to the earth as it was; and the spirit shall return
unto God who gave it." It would be in vain to attempt
to describe the manner in which these words were spoken;
and which fell upon those who heard them as though they
were listening to one from the dead.</p>

<p>"My mother!&mdash;my mother!" at length faltered Aubrey.</p>

<p>"God bless thee, my son!" said she, solemnly. "And
Catherine, my daughter&mdash;God bless thee"&mdash;&mdash; she
presently added, gently turning round her head towards
the quarter whence a stifled sob issued from Miss Aubrey,
who rose, trembling, and leaning over, kissed her mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
"Agnes, are you here&mdash;and your little ones?&mdash;God
bless"&mdash;&mdash; Her voice got fainter, and her eyes closed.
Mr. Whately gave her a few drops of ether, and she
presently revived.</p>

<p>"God hath been very good to you, Madam," said Dr.
Tatham, observing her eye fixed upon him, "to restore
you thus to your children."</p>

<p>"I have been long absent&mdash;long!&mdash;I wake, my children,
but to bid you farewell, forever, upon earth."</p>

<p>"Say not so, my mother&mdash;my precious mother!"
exclaimed her son, in vain endeavoring to suppress his emotions.</p>

<p>"I do, my son! Weep not for me; I am old, and
am summoned away from among you"&mdash;She ceased, as if
from exhaustion; and no one spoke for some minutes.</p>

<p>"It may be that God hath roused me, as it were, from
the dead, to comfort my sorrowful children with words of
hope," said Mrs. Aubrey, with much more power and
distinctness than before. "Hope ye, then, in God; for
ye shall yet praise him who is the health of your countenance,
and your God!"</p>

<p>"We will remember, my mother, your words!" faltered
her son.</p>

<p>"Yes, my son&mdash;if days of darkness be at hand"&mdash;She
ceased. Again Mr. Whately placed to her white
lips a glass with some reviving fluid&mdash;looking ominously
at Mr. Aubrey, as he found that she continued insensible.
Miss Aubrey sobbed audibly; indeed all present were
powerfully affected. Again Mrs. Aubrey revived, and
swallowed a few drops of wine and water. A heavenly
serenity diffused itself over her emaciated features.</p>

<p>"We shall meet again, my loves!&mdash;I can no longer
see you with the eyes of"&mdash;Mr. Whately observing a
sudden change, came nearer to her.</p>

<p>"Peace! peace!" she murmured almost inarticulately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
A dead silence ensued, interrupted only by smothered
sobs. Her children sank on their knees, and buried their
faces in their hands, trembling.</p>

<p>Mr. Whately made a silent signal to Dr. Tatham, that
life had ceased&mdash;that the beloved spirit had passed away.
"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: blessed
be the name of the Lord!" said Dr. Tatham, with tremulous
solemnity. Mrs. Aubrey and Miss Aubrey, no longer
able to restrain their feelings, wept bitterly; and overpowered
with grief, were supported out of the room by
Dr. Tatham and Mr. Aubrey.</p>

<p>As soon as it was known that this venerable lady was no
more, universal reverence was testified for her memory,
and sympathy for the afflicted survivors, by even those,
high and low, in the remoter parts of the neighborhood
who had no personal acquaintance with the family. Two
or three days afterwards, the undertaker, who had received
orders from Mr. Aubrey to provide a simple and inexpensive
funeral, submitted to him a list of more than thirty
names of the nobility and gentry of the country, who had
sent to him to know whether it would be agreeable to the
family for them to be allowed to attend Mrs. Aubrey's
remains to the grave. After much consideration, Mr.
Aubrey accepted this spontaneous tribute of respect to
the memory of his mother. 'Twas a memorable and
melancholy day on which the interment took place&mdash;one
never to be forgotten at Yatton. What can be more
chilling than the gloomy bustle of a great funeral, especially
in the country; and when the deceased is one whose
memory is enshrined in the holiest feelings of all who
knew her? What person was there, for miles around,
who could not speak of the courtesies, the charities, the
goodness of Madam Aubrey?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>When the ear heard her, then it blessed her; and when the eye
saw her, it gave witness to her:</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>

<p><i>"Because she delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless,
and him that had none to help him</i>.</p>

<p><i>"The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon her,
and she caused the widow's heart to sing for joy</i>.</p>

<p><i>"She was eyes to the blind, and feet was she to the lame</i>.</p>

<p><i>"She was a mother to the poor</i>."&mdash;&mdash;</p></div>

<p>Pale as death, the chief mourner, wrapped in his black
cloak, is stepping into the mourning-coach. No one
speaks to him; his face is buried in his handkerchief; his
heart seems breaking. He thinks of her whose dear dust
is before him;&mdash;then of the beloved beings whom he has
left alone in their agony till his return&mdash;his wife and
sister. The procession is moving slowly on&mdash;long, silent
rows of the tenantry and villagers, old and young, male
and female&mdash;not a dry eye among them, nor a syllable
spoken&mdash;stand on each side of the way; no sound heard
but of horses' feet, and wheels crushing along the wet
gravel&mdash;for the day is most gloomy and inclement. As
they quit the gates, carriage after carriage follows in the
rear; and the sorrowful crowd increases around them.
Many have in their hands the Bibles and prayer-books
which had been given them by her who now lies in
yonder hearse; and a few can recollect the day when the
late lord of Yatton led her along from the church to the
Hall, his young and blooming bride&mdash;in pride and joy&mdash;and
they are now going to lay her beside him again!
They are met at the entrance of the little churchyard, by
good Dr. Tatham, in his surplice, bareheaded, and with
book in hand; with full eye and quivering lip he slowly
precedes the body into the church. His voice frequently
trembles, and sometimes he pauses while reading the service.
Now they are standing bareheaded at the vault's
mouth&mdash;the last sad rites are being performed; and probably,
as is thinking the chief mourner, over the last of
his race who will rest in that tomb!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span></p>

<p>Long after the solemn ceremony was over, the little
churchyard remained filled with mournful groups of villagers
and tenants, who pressed forward to the dark
mouth of the vault, to take their last look at the coffin
which contained the remains of her whose memory would
live long in all their hearts. "Ah, dear old Madam,"
quoth Jonas Higgs to himself, as he finished his dreary
day's labors, by temporarily closing up the mouth of
the vault, "they might have turned thee, by-and-by,
out of yonder Hall, but they shall not touch thee <i>here</i>!"</p>

<p>Thus died, and was buried, Madam Aubrey; <i>and she is
not yet forgotten</i>.</p>

<p>How desolate seemed the Hall, the next morning, to
the bereaved inmates, as, dressed in deep mourning, they
met at the cheerless breakfast-table! Aubrey kissed his
wife and sister&mdash;who could hardly answer his brief inquiries.
The gloom occasioned throughout the Hall, for
the last ten days, by the windows being constantly darkened&mdash;now
that the blinds were drawn up&mdash;had given
way to a staring light and distinctness, which almost
startled and offended the eyes of those whose hearts were
dark with sorrow as ever. Every object reminded them
of the absence of <i>one</i>&mdash;whose chair stood empty in its
accustomed place. There, also, was her Bible, on the
little round table near the window! The mourners
seemed relieved by the entrance, by-and-by, of the children;
but they also were in mourning! Let us, however,
withdraw from this scene of suffering, where every object,
every recollection, every association, causes the wounded
heart to bleed afresh.</p>

<p>Great troubles seem coming upon them; and now that
<i>they have buried their dead out of their sight</i>, and when time
shall have begun to pour his balm into their present
smarting wounds, I doubt not that they will look those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
troubles in the face, calmly and with fortitude, not forgetful
of the last words of her for whom they now mourn so
bitterly, and whom, beloved and venerable being! God
hath mercifully taken away from evil days that are to
come.</p>

<p>After much consideration, they resolved to go, on the
ensuing Sunday morning, to church, where neither Mrs.
Aubrey nor Kate had been since the illness of her mother.
The little church was crowded; almost every one present,
besides wearing a saddened countenance, exhibited some
outward mark of respect, in their dress&mdash;some badge of
mourning&mdash;such as their little means admitted of. The
pulpit and reading-desk were hung in black, as also was
Mr. Aubrey's pew&mdash;an object of deep interest to the
congregation, who expected to see at least <i>some</i> member
of the family at the Hall. They were not disappointed.
A little before Dr. Tatham took his place in the reading-desk,
the well-known sound of the family-carriage wheels
was heard as it drew up before the gate; and presently
Mr. Aubrey appeared at the church door, with his wife
and sister on either arm; all of them, of course, in
the deepest mourning&mdash;Mrs. and Miss Aubrey's countenances
concealed beneath their long crape veils. For
some time after taking their seats, they seemed oppressed
with emotion, evidently weeping. Mr. Aubrey, however,
exhibited great composure, though his countenance bore
traces of the suffering he had undergone. Mrs. Aubrey
seldom rose from her seat; but Kate stood up, from time
to time, with the rest of the congregation; her white
handkerchief, however, might have been seen frequently
raised to her eyes, beneath her black veil. As the service
went on, she seemed to have struggled with some success
against her feelings. To relieve herself for a moment
from its oppressive closeness, she gently drew aside her
veil; and thus, for a few minutes, exhibited a countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
which, though pale and agitated, was inexpressibly beautiful.
She could not, however, long bear to face a congregation,
every one of whom she felt to be looking on her,
and those beside her, with affectionate sympathy; and
rather quickly drew down her veil, without again removing
it. There was one person present, on whom the brief
glimpse of her beauty had produced a sudden, deep, and
indelible impression. As he gazed at her, the color gradually
deserted his cheek; and his eye remained fixed
upon her, even after she had drawn down her veil. He
experienced emotions such as he had never known before.
<i>So that was Miss Aubrey!</i></p>

<p>Mr. Gammon&mdash;for he it was, and he had gone thither
under the expectation of seeing, for the first time, some of
the Aubrey family&mdash;generally passed for a cold-blooded
person; and in fact few men living had more control over
their feelings, or more systematically checked any manifestations
of them; but there was something in the person
and circumstances of Miss Aubrey&mdash;for by a hurried inquiry
of the person next to him he learned that it was she&mdash;which
excited new feelings in him. Her slightest motion
his eye watched with intense eagerness; and faint
half-formed schemes, purposes, and hopes, passed in rapid
confusion through his mind, as he foresaw that circumstances
would hereafter arise by means of which&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good heavens! how very&mdash;<i>very</i> beautiful she is!"
said he to himself, as, the service over, her graceful figure,
following her brother and his wife with slow sad step,
approached the pew in which he was standing, on her way
to the door. He felt a sort of cold shudder as her black
dress rustled past, actually touching him. What was he
doing and meditating against that lovely being? And for
whom&mdash;disgusting reptile!&mdash;for Titmouse? He almost
blushed from a conflict of emotions, as he followed almost
immediately after Miss Aubrey, never losing sight of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
till her brother, having handed her into the carriage, got
in after her, and they drove off towards the Hall.</p>

<p>The reader will not be at a loss to account for the presence
of Mr. Gammon on this occasion, nor to connect it
with an impending trial at the approaching York assizes.
As he walked back to Grilston to his solitary dinner, he
was lost in thought; and on arriving at the inn, repaired
at once to his room, where he found a copy of the <i>Sunday
Flash</i>, which had, according to orders, been sent to him
from town, under his assumed name, "Gibson." He ate
but little, and that mechanically; and seemed to feel, for
once, little or no interest in his newspaper. He had never
paid the least attention to the <i>eulogia</i> upon Miss Aubrey of
the idiot Titmouse, nor of Snap, of whom he entertained
but a very little higher opinion than of Titmouse. One
thing was clear, that from that moment Miss Aubrey
formed a new element in Mr. Gammon's calculations;
and for aught I know, may occasion very different results
from those originally contemplated by that calm
and crafty person.</p>

<p>As it proved a moonlight night, he resolved at once to
set about the important business which had brought him
into Yorkshire; and for that purpose set off about eight
o'clock on his walk to Yatton. About ten o'clock he
might have been seen gliding noiselessly into the churchyard,
like a dangerous snake. The moon continued to
shine&mdash;and at intervals with brightness sufficient for
his purpose, which was simply to reconnoitre, as closely
as possible, the little sequestered locality&mdash;to ascertain
what it might contain, and <i>what were its capabilities</i>. At
length he approached the old yew-tree, against the huge
trunk of which he leaned with folded arms, apparently in
a revery. Hearing a noise as of some one opening the
gate by which he had entered, he glided farther into the
gloom behind him; and turning his head in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
whence the sound came, he beheld some one entering the
churchyard. His heart beat quickly; and he suspected
that he had been watched: yet there was surely no harm
in being seen, at ten o'clock at night, looking about him
in a country churchyard!&mdash;It was a gentleman who entered,
dressed in deep mourning; and Gammon quickly
recognized in him Mr. Aubrey&mdash;the brother of her
whose beautiful image still shone before his mind's eye.
What could he be wanting there?&mdash;at that time of
night? Gammon was not kept long in doubt; for the
stranger slowly bent his steps towards a large high tomb,
in fact the central object, next to the yew-tree, in the
churchyard&mdash;and stood gazing at it in silence for some time.</p>

<p>"That is, no doubt, where Mrs. Aubrey was buried the
other day," thought Gammon, watching the movements
of the stranger, who presently raised his handkerchief to
his eyes, and for some moments seemed indulging in great
grief. Gammon distinctly heard the sound of deep sighing.
"He must have been very fond of her," thought
Gammon. "Well, if we succeed, the excellent old lady
will have escaped a great deal of trouble&mdash;that's all!
<i>If we succeed</i>," he inwardly repeated after a long pause!
That reminded him of what he had for a few moments lost
sight of, namely, his own object in coming thither; and
he felt a sudden chill of remorse, which increased upon
him till he almost trembled, as his eye continued fixed
on Mr. Aubrey, and he thought also of Miss Aubrey&mdash;and
the misery&mdash;the utter ruin into which he was seeking
to plunge them both&mdash;the unhallowed means which
they&mdash;which&mdash;if necessary&mdash;he&mdash;contemplated resorting
to for that purpose.</p>

<p>Gammon's condition was becoming every moment more
serious; for <span class="smcap">virtue</span>, in the shape of Miss Aubrey, began
to shine momentarily in more and more radiant loveliness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
before him&mdash;and he almost felt an inclination to sacrifice
every person connected with the enterprise in which he
was engaged, if it would give him a chance of winning
the favor of Miss Aubrey. Presently, however, Mr. Aubrey,
evidently heaving a deep sigh, bent his steps slowly
back towards the old gate, and quitted the churchyard.
Gammon watched his figure out of sight, and then, for
the first time since Mr. Aubrey's appearance, breathed
freely. Relieved from the pressure of his presence, Gammon
began to take calmer and juster views of his position;
and he reflected, that if he pushed on the present
affair to a successful issue, he should be much more likely,
than by prematurely ending it, to gain his objects. He
therefore resumed his survey of the scene around him;
and which presented appearances highly satisfactory, judging
from the expression which now and then animated his
countenance. At length he wandered round to the other
end of the church, where a crumbling wall, half covered
with ivy, indicated that there had formerly stood some
building apparently of earlier date than the church.
Such was the fact. Gammon soon found himself standing
in a sort of enclosure, which had once been the site
of an old chapel. And here he had not been long making
his observations, before he achieved a discovery of
so extraordinary a nature; one so unlikely, under the
circumstances, to have happened; one so calculated to
baffle ordinary calculations concerning the course of
events, that the reader may well disbelieve what I am
going to tell him, and treat it as absurdly improbable.
In short, not to keep him in suspense, Gammon positively
discovered evidence of the death of Harry Dreddlington
in his father's lifetime; by means of just such a looking
tombstone as he had long imaged to himself; and as he
had resolved that old Quirk should have got prepared,
before the cause came into court. He almost stumbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
over it. 'Twas an old slanting stone, scarcely a foot
above the ground, partly covered with moss, and partly
hid by rubbish and long damp grass. The moon shone
brightly enough to enable Gammon, kneeling down, to
decipher, beyond all doubt, what was requisite to establish
that part of the case which had been wanting. For
a moment or two he was disposed to imagine that he
was dreaming. When, at length, he took out pencil and
paper, his hands trembled so much that he felt some difficulty
in making an exact copy of the inestimable inscription.
Having done this, he drew a long breath as
he replaced the pencil and paper in his pocket-book, and
almost fancied he heard a whispering sound in the air&mdash;"Verdict
for the plaintiff." Quitting the churchyard, he
walked back to Grilston at a much quicker rate than that
at which he had come, his discovery having wonderfully
elated him, and pushed all other thoughts entirely out
of his mind. But, thought he, doubtless the other side
are aware of the existence of this tombstone&mdash;they can
hardly be supposed ignorant of it; they must have looked
up their evidence as well as we&mdash;and their attention has
been challenged to the existence or non-existence of proof
of the time of the death of Harry Dreddlington:&mdash;well&mdash;if
they are aware of it, they know that it cuts the
ground from under them, and turns their conveyance,
on which, doubtless, they are relying, into waste paper;
if they are <i>not</i>, and are under the impression that that
deed is valid and effectual, our proof will fall on them
like a thunderbolt. "Gad,"&mdash;he held his breath, and
stopped in the middle of the road&mdash;"how immensely
important is this little piece of evidence! Why, if they
knew of it&mdash;why in Heaven's name is it there still?
What easier than to have got rid of it?&mdash;why, they
may still: what can that stupid fellow Parkinson have
been about? Yet, is it because it has become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
unimportant, on account of their being in possession of other
evidence? What <i>can</i> they have to set against so plain
a case as ours is, with this evidence? Gad, I'll not lose
one day's time; but I'll have half a dozen competent
witnesses to inspect, and speak to that same tombstone
in court." Such were some of the thoughts which passed
through his mind as he hastened homeward; and on his
arrival, late as it was&mdash;only the yawning hostler having
sat up to let him in&mdash;he wrote off a letter to Mr. Quirk,
and made it into a parcel to go by the mail in the morning,
acquainting him with the amazing discovery which
he had just made, and urging Mr. Quirk to set about
getting up the briefs, for the trial, without delay; he
himself&mdash;Gammon&mdash;purposing to stop at Grilston a day
or two longer, to complete one or two other arrangements
of an important nature. As soon as Mr. Quirk had read
this letter, he devoutly thanked God for his goodness;
and, hurrying to his strong-box, unlocked it, took out a
small sealed packet, and committed it to the flames.</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey, as soon as he had recovered from the first
shock occasioned by Mr. Parkinson's communication of
the proceedings against him, set about acquainting himself,
as minutely as he could, with the true state of the
case. He had requested that gentleman to obtain from
one of the counsel in London, Mr. Crystal, a full account
of the case for his&mdash;Mr. Aubrey's&mdash;own guidance; and
on obtaining a remarkably clear and luminous statement,
and also consulting the various authorities cited in it&mdash;such
at least as could be supplied to him by Mr. Parkinson&mdash;the
vigorous practical understanding of Mr. Aubrey,
aided by his patient application, soon mastered the whole
case, and enabled him to appreciate his perilous position.
Since he could derive no title through the conveyance of
Harry Dreddlington (which had been got in by Geoffrey
Dreddlington,) owing to the death of the former in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
father's lifetime,[<a href='#Note_29'>29</a>] as he (Mr. Aubrey) understood from
his advisers could be easily proved by the present claimant
of the property; the right of accession of Geoffrey
Dreddlington's descendants depended entirely upon the
fact whether or not Stephen Dreddlington had really died
without issue; and as to that, certain anxious and extensive
inquiries instituted by Messrs. Runnington and Mr.
Parkinson, in pursuance of the suggestions of their able
and experienced counsel, had led them to entertain serious
doubts concerning the right of Geoffrey's descendants
to have entered into possession. By what means his
opponents had obtained their clew to the state of his
title, neither Mr. Aubrey nor any of his advisers could
frame a plausible conjecture. It was certainly possible
that Stephen Dreddlington, who was known to have been
a man, like his uncle Harry, of wild and eccentric habits,
and to have been supposed to leave no issue, might have
married privately some woman of inferior station, and
left issue by her, who, living in obscurity, and at a distance
from the seat of the family property, could have no
opportunity of inquiring into or ascertaining their position
with reference to the estates, till some acute and
enterprising attorneys, like Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and
Snap, happening to get hold of them, and family papers
in their possession, had taken up their case. When, with
impressions such as these, Mr. Aubrey perused and re-perused
the opinions of the conveyancer given on the
occasion of his (Mr. Aubrey's) marriage, he was confounded
at the supineness and indifference which he had
even twice exhibited, and felt disposed now greatly to
overvalue the importance of every adverse circumstance.
The boldness, again, and systematic energy with which
the case of the claimant was prosecuted, and the eminent
legal opinions which were alleged, and with every appearance
of truth, to concur in his favor, afforded additional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
grounds for rational apprehension. He looked the danger,
however, full in the face, and as far as lay in his power,
as a conscientious man, prepared for the evil day which
might so soon come upon him. Certain extensive and
somewhat costly alterations which he had been on the
point of commencing at Yatton, he abandoned. But for
the earnest interference of friends, he would at once have
given up his establishment in Grosvenor Street, and applied
for the Chiltern Hundreds, in order to retire from
political life. Considering the possibility of his soon
being declared the wrongful holder of the property, he
contracted his expenditure as far as he could, without
challenging unnecessary public attention; and paid into
his banker's hands all his Christmas rents, sacredly resolving
to abstain from drawing out one farthing of what
might soon be proved to belong to another. At every
point occurred the dreadful question&mdash;if I am declared
never to have been the rightful owner of the property,
how am I to discharge my frightful liabilities to him who
is? Mr. Aubrey had nothing except the Yatton property.
He had but an insignificant sum in the funds; Mrs.
Aubrey's settlement was out of lands at Yatton, as also
was the little income bequeathed to Kate by her father.
Could anything be conceived more dreadful, under these
circumstances, than the mere danger&mdash;the slightest
probability&mdash;of their being deprived of Yatton?&mdash;and
with a debt of at the very least <span class="smcap">sixty thousand pounds</span>,
due to him who had been wrongfully kept out of his property?
That was the millstone which seemed to drag
them all to the bottom. Against <i>that</i>, what could the
kindness of the most generous friends, what could his
own most desperate exertions, avail? All this had poor
Aubrey constantly before his eyes, together with&mdash;his
wife, his children, his sister. What was to become of
<i>them</i>? It was long before the real nature and extent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
his danger became known among his friends and neighbors.
When, however, they were made aware of it, an
extraordinary interest and sympathy were excited throughout
almost the whole county. Whenever his attorney,
Mr. Parkinson, appeared in public, he was besieged by
most anxious inquiries concerning his distinguished client,
whose manly modesty and fortitude, under the pressure
of his sudden and almost unprecedented difficulty and
peril, endeared him more than ever to all who had an
opportunity of appreciating his position. With what
intense and absorbing interest were the ensuing assizes
looked for!&mdash;-- At length they arrived.</p>

<p>The ancient city of York exhibited, on the commission
day of the spring assizes for the year 18&mdash;, the usual
scene of animation and excitement. The High Sheriff,
attended by an imposing retinue, went out to meet the
judges, and escorted them, amid the shrill clangor of
trumpets, to the Castle, where the commission was
opened with the usual formalities. The judges were
Lord Widdrington, the Lord Chief-Justice of the King's
Bench, and Mr. Justice Grayley, a puisne judge of the
same court&mdash;both admirable lawyers. The former was
possessed of the more powerful intellect. He was what
may be called a great scientific lawyer, referring everything
to <i>principle</i>, as extracted from precedent. Mr.
Justice Grayley was almost unrivalled in his knowledge
of the <i>details</i> of the law; his governing maxim being <i>ita
lex scripta</i>. Here his knowledge was equally minute and
accurate, and most readily applied to every case brought
before him. Never sat there upon the bench a more
painstaking judge&mdash;one more anxious to do right equally
in great things as in small. Both were men of rigid
integrity: 'tis a glorious thing to be able to challenge
the inquiry&mdash;when, for centuries, have other than men
of rigid integrity sat upon the English Bench? Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
Widdrington, however, in temper was stern, arbitrary,
and overbearing, and his manners were disfigured not a
little by coarseness; while his companion was a man of
exemplary amiability, affability, and forbearance. Lord
Widdrington presided at the Civil Court, (in which, of
course, would come on the important cause in which we
are interested,) and Mr. Justice Grayley in the Criminal Court.</p>

<p>Soon after the sitting of the court, on the ensuing
morning&mdash;"Will your Lordship allow me," rose and
inquired the sleek, smiling, and portly Mr. Subtle, dead
silence prevailing as soon as he had mentioned the name
of the cause about which he was inquiring, "to mention
a cause of <i>Doe on the demise of Titmouse v. Jolter</i>&mdash;a
special jury cause, in which there are a great many witnesses
to be examined on both sides&mdash;and to ask that a
day may be fixed for it to come on?"</p>

<p>"Whom do you appear for, Mr. Subtle?" inquired his Lordship.</p>

<p>"For the plaintiff, my Lord."</p>

<p>"And who appears for the defendant?"</p>

<p>"The Attorney-General leads for the defendant, my
Lord," replied Mr. Sterling, who, with Mr. Crystal, was
also retained for the defendant.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps you can agree between yourselves upon
a day, and in the mean time similar arrangements may
be made for any other special jury causes that may require
it." After due consultation, Monday week was
agreed upon by the parties, and fixed by his Lordship,
for the trial of the cause.&mdash;During the Sunday preceding
it, York was crowded with persons of the highest distinction
from all parts of the county, who felt interested in
the result of the great cause of the assizes. About mid-day
a dusty travelling carriage and four dashed into the
streets from the London road, and drove up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
principal inn; it contained the Attorney-General (who just
finished reading his brief as he entered York) and his
clerk. The Attorney-General was a man of striking and
highly intellectual countenance; but he looked, on alighting,
somewhat fatigued with his long journey. He was a
man of extraordinary natural talents, and also a first-rate
lawyer&mdash;one whose right to take the woolsack, whenever
it should become vacant, was recognized by all the profession.
His professional celebrity, and his coming down
"<i>special</i>" on the present occasion, added to the circumstance
of his being well known to be a personal friend of
his client, Mr. Aubrey&mdash;whence it might be inferred
that his great powers would be exerted to their utmost&mdash;was
well calculated to enhance the interest, if that
were possible, of the occasion which had brought him
down at so great an expense, and to sustain so heavy a
responsibility as the conduct of a cause of such magnitude
as this.</p>

<p>He came to lead against a formidable opponent. Mr.
Subtle was the leader of the Northern circuit, a man of
matchless tact and practical sagacity, and consummately
skilful in the conduct of a cause. The only thing <i>he</i> ever
looked at, was <span class="smcap">the verdict</span>; to the gaining of which he
directed all his energies, and sacrificed every other consideration.
As for display, he despised it. A <i>speech</i>, as
such, was his aversion. He entered into a friendly, but
exquisitely crafty <i>conversation</i> with the jury; for he was
so quick at perceiving the effect of his address on the
mind of each of the twelve, and dexterous in accommodating
himself to what he had detected to be the passing
mood of each, that they individually felt as if they were
all the while reasoning with, and being convinced by
him. His placid, smiling, handsome countenance, his
gentlemanly bearing and insinuating address, full of good-natured
cheerful confidence in his cause, were irresistible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
He flattered, he soothed, he fascinated the jury, producing
an impression upon their minds which they often felt
indignant at his opponent's attempting to efface. In fact,
as a <i>nisi prius</i> leader he was unrivalled, as well in stating
as in arguing a case, as well in examining as cross-examining
a witness. It required no little practical experience
to form an adequate estimate of Mr. Subtle's skill in the
management of a cause; for he did everything with such
a smiling, careless, unconcerned air, equally in the great
pinch and strain of a case, as in the pettiest details, that
you would be apt to suspect that none but the easiest and
most straightforward cases fell to his lot!</p>

<p>Titmouse, Titmouse, methinks the fates favored you in
assigning to you Mr. Subtle!</p>

<p>Next came Mr. <span class="smcap">Quicksilver</span>, who had received what
may be called a <i>muffling</i> retainer. What a contrast was
he to Mr. Subtle! Reckless, rhetorical, eloquent, ready,
witty&mdash;possessing a vast extent of general knowledge,
but rather slenderly furnished with law&mdash;he presented
to the jury, <i>himself</i>&mdash;not his client, or his client's case;
infinitely more anxious to make a splendid figure in public,
than to secure, by watchful activity, the interests of
his clients. Why, then, was such a man retained in the
cause? 'Twas a fancy of Quirk's, a vast political admirer
of Quicksilver's, who had made one or two most splendid
speeches for him in libel cases brought against the <i>Sunday
Flash</i>. Gammon most earnestly expostulated, but Quirk
was inexorable; and himself carried his retainer to Mr.
Quicksilver. Gammon, however, was somewhat consoled
by the reflection, that this wild elephant would be, in a
manner, held in check by Mr. Subtle and Mr. Lynx, who,
he hoped, would prevent any serious mischief from happening.
Lynx possessed the qualities which his name would
suggest to you. I have partly described him already. He
was a man of minute accuracy; and "got up" every case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
in which he was engaged as if his life had depended on
the result. Nothing escaped him. He kept his mind constantly
even with the current of the cause. He was a
man to <i>steer</i> a leader, if ever that leader should get, for
an instant, on the wrong tack, or be uncertain as to his
course. His suggestion and interference&mdash;rare, indeed,
with such a man as Mr. Subtle, incessant with Mr. Quicksilver&mdash;were
always worth attending to, and consequently
received with deference.</p>

<p>For Mr. Aubrey also was retained a formidable "<span class="smcap">bar</span>."
Mr. Attorney-General was a man much superior, in point
of intellect and legal knowledge, to Mr. Subtle. His mind
was distinguished by its tranquil power. He had a rare
and invaluable faculty of arraying before his mind's eye
all the facts and bearings of the most intricate case, and
contemplating them, as it were, not successively, but
simultaneously. His perception was quick as light; and,
at the same time&mdash;rare, most rare accompaniment!&mdash;his
judgment sound, his memory signally retentive. Inferior,
possibly, to Mr. Subtle in rapid and delicate appreciation
of momentary advantages, he was sagacious, where Mr.
Subtle was only ingenious. Mr. Attorney-General had as
much weight with the judge as Mr. Subtle with the jury.
With the former there was a candor and straightforwardness&mdash;a
dignified simplicity&mdash;which insensibly won the
confidence of the judge; who, on the other hand, felt himself
obliged to be ever on his guard against the slippery
sophistries of Mr. Subtle, whom he thus got to regard
with constant suspicion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sterling</span>, the second counsel for the defendant,
was a king's counsel, and a rival of Mr. Subtle upon the
circuit. He was a man of great power; and, on important
occasions, no man at the bar could acquit himself
with more distinction. As a speaker, he was eloquent
and impressive, perhaps deficient in vivacity; but he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
a man of clear and powerful intellect; prompt in seizing
the bearings of a case; a capital lawyer; and possessing,
even on the most trying occasions, imperturbable self-possession.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crystal</span>, with some faults of manner and bearing,
was an honorable high-minded man; clear-sighted and
strong-headed; an accurate and ready lawyer; vigilant
and acute.</p>

<p>See, then, the combatants in this memorable encounter;
for <i>Titmouse</i>&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Subtle</span>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Quicksilver</span>, Mr.
<span class="smcap">Lynx</span>; for <i>Mr. Aubrey</i>&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Attorney-General</span>, Mr.
<span class="smcap">Sterling</span>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Crystal</span>.</p>

<p>The consultation of each party was long and anxious.</p>

<p>About eight o'clock on the Sunday evening, at Mr.
Subtle's lodgings, Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, accompanied
by Mr. Mortmain, whom they had brought
down to watch the case, made their appearance shortly
after Mr. Quicksilver and Mr. Lynx.</p>

<p>"Our case seems complete, <i>now</i>" said Mr. Subtle, casting
a penetrating and most significant glance at Messrs.
Quirk and Gammon, and then at his juniors, to whom,
before the arrival of their clients and Mr. Mortmain, he
had been mentioning the essential link which, a month
before, he had pointed out as missing, and the marvellous
good fortune by which they had been able to supply it at
the eleventh hour.</p>

<p>"That tombstone's a godsend, Subtle, isn't it?" said
Quicksilver, with a grim smile. Lynx neither smiled nor
spoke. He was a very matter-of-fact person. So as the
case came out clear and nice in court, he cared about
nothing more; at that moment he felt that he should be
<i>functus officio</i>!&mdash;But whatever might be the insinuation
or suspicion implied in the observation of Mr. Subtle, the
reader must, by this time, be well aware how little it was
warranted by the facts.[<a href='#Note_30'>30</a>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall open it very quietly," said Mr. Subtle, putting
into his pocket his penknife, with which he had been paring
his nails, while Mr. Quicksilver had been talking very
fast. "What do you think, Mr. Lynx? Had I better
allude boldly to the conveyance executed by Harry Dreddlington,
and which becomes useless as soon as we prove
his death in his father's lifetime?"</p>

<p>"Ah! there's that blessed tombstone again," interposed
Quicksilver, with a sarcastic smile.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Or," resumed Mr. Subtle, "content myself with
barely making out our pedigree, and let the conveyance
of Harry Dreddlington come from the other side?"</p>

<p>"I think, perhaps, that the latter would be the quieter
and safer course," replied Lynx.</p>

<p>"By the way, gentlemen," said Mr. Subtle, suddenly,
addressing Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, "how do
we come to know anything about the mortgage executed
by Harry Dreddlington?"</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>that</i> you know," replied Quirk, quickly, "we first
got scent of in Mr."&mdash;&mdash; Here he paused suddenly,
and turned quite red.</p>

<p>"It was suggested," said Gammon, calmly, "by one of
the gentlemen whose opinions we have taken in the case&mdash;I
forget by whom&mdash;that, from some recital, it was
probable that there existed such an instrument; and that
put us on making inquiry."</p>

<p>"Nothing more likely," added Mortmain, "than that
it, or an abstract, or minute of it, should get into Stephen
Dreddlington's hands!"</p>

<p>"Ah! well! well!" said Mr. Subtle, shrugging his
shoulders,&mdash;"I must say there's rather an air of mystery
about the case. But&mdash;about that tombstone&mdash;what
sort of witnesses will speak"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will the evidence be requisite," inquired Lynx, "in
the plaintiff's case? All <i>we</i> shall have to do will be to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
prove the fact that Harry died without issue, of which
there's satisfactory evidence; and as to the <i>time</i> of his
death, that will become material only if <i>they</i> put in the
conveyance of Harry."</p>

<p>"True&mdash;true; ah! I'll turn that over in my mind.
Rely upon it, I'll give Mr. Attorney-General as little
to lay hold of as possible. Thank you, Lynx, for the
hint. Now, gentlemen," said he, turning to Messrs.
Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, "one other question&mdash;What
<i>kind of looking</i> people are the witnesses who prove the
later steps of the pedigree of Mr. Titmouse? Respectable?
eh?&mdash;You know a good deal will depend on the
credit which they may obtain with the jury!"</p>

<p>"They're very decent creditable persons, you will find,
sir," said Gammon.</p>

<p>"Good, good. Who struck the special jury?"</p>

<p>"We did, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I must say that was a <i>very</i> prudent step for
<i>you</i> to take! considering the rank in life and circumstances
of the respective parties! However, to be sure,
if <i>you</i> didn't, they would&mdash;so&mdash;well; good-night, gentlemen,
good-night." So the consultation broke up; and
Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap returned home to their
inn in a very serious and anxious mood.</p>

<p>"You're a marvellous prudent person, Mr. Quirk,"
said Gammon, in a somewhat fierce whisper, as they
walked along, "I suppose you would have gone on to explain
the little matter of Steggars, and so have had our
briefs thrown at our heads"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, well," grunted Quirk, "that <i>was</i> a slip!" Here
they reached their inn. Titmouse was staying there;
and in Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap's absence, he
had got very drunk, and was quarrelling under the archway
with "Boots;" so they ordered him to bed, they themselves
sitting up till a very late hour in the morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span></p>

<p>The consultation at the Attorney-General's had taken
place about three o'clock in the afternoon, within an hour
after his arrival; and had been attended by Messrs. Sterling,
Crystal, and Mansfield&mdash;by Mr. Runnington, and
Mr. Parkinson, and by Mr. Aubrey, whom the Attorney-General
received with the most earnest expressions of
sympathy and friendship; listening to every question and
every observation of his with the utmost deference.</p>

<p>"It would be both idle and unkind to disguise from
you, Aubrey," said he, "that our position is somewhat
precarious. It depends entirely on the chance we may
have of breaking down the plaintiff's case; for we have
but a slender one of our own. I suppose they can bring
proof of the death of Harry Dreddlington in his father's lifetime?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir!" answered Mr. Parkinson, "there is an
old tombstone behind Yatton church which establishes
that fact beyond all doubt: and a week or two ago no
fewer than five or six persons have been carefully inspecting
it; doubtless they will be called as witnesses to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I feared as much. Then are ours no more than
watching briefs. Depend upon it, they would not have
carried on the affair with so high a hand if they had not
pretty firm ground under foot! Messrs. Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap are tolerably well known in town&mdash;not
<i>over</i>-scrupulous, eh, Mr. Runnington?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mr. Attorney, you are right. I don't doubt
they are prepared to go all lengths."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll sift their evidence pretty closely, at any
rate. So you really have reason to fear, as you intimated
when you entered the room, that they have valid evidence
of Stephen Dreddlington having left issue?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Snap told me," said Mr. Parkinson, "this morning,
that they would prove issue of Stephen Dreddlington,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
and issue of that issue, as clean as a whistle&mdash;that was
his phrase."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay&mdash;but we mustn't take all for gospel that
<i>he</i> would say," replied the Attorney-General, smiling sarcastically.</p>

<p>"They've got two houses filled with witnesses, I understand,"
said Mr. Runnington.</p>

<p>"Do they seem Yorkshire people, or strangers?"</p>

<p>"Why, most of them that I have seen," replied Parkinson,
"seem strangers."</p>

<p>"Ah, they will prove, I suppose," said the Attorney-General,
"the later steps of the pedigree, when Stephen
Dreddlington married at a distance from his native county."</p>

<p>They then entered into a very full and minute examination
of the case; after which,&mdash;"Well," said the
Attorney-General, evidently fatigued with his long journey,
and rising from his chair, "we must trust to what
will turn up in the chapter of accidents to-morrow. I
shall be expected to dine with the bar to-day," he added;
"but immediately after dinner&mdash;say at half-past seven
o'clock, I shall be here and at your service, if anything
should be required." Then the consultation broke up.
Mr. Aubrey had, at their earnest entreaty, brought Mrs.
Aubrey and Kate from Yatton, on Saturday; for they
declared themselves unable to bear the dreadful suspense
in which they should be left at Yatton. Yielding, therefore,
to these their very reasonable wishes, he had engaged
private lodgings at the outskirts of the town. On quitting
the consultation, which, without at the same time
affecting over-strictness, he had regretted being fixed for
Sunday&mdash;but the necessity of the case appeared to warrant
it&mdash;he repaired to the magnificent <span class="smcap">minster</span>, where
the evening prayers were being read, and where were
Mrs. Aubrey and Kate. The prayers were being chanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
as he entered; and he was conducted to a stall nearly
opposite to where those whom he loved so fondly were
standing. The psalms allotted for the evening were those
in which the royal sufferer, David, was pouring forth the
deepest sorrows of his heart; and their appropriateness to
Mr. Aubrey's state of mind, added to the effect produced
by the melting melody in which they were conveyed to
his ears, excited in him, and, he perceived, also in those
opposite, the deepest emotion. The glorious pile was beginning
to grow dusky with the stealing shadows of evening;
and the solemn and sublime strains of the organ,
during the playing of the anthem, filled those present, who
had any pretensions to sensibility, with mingled feelings
of tenderness and awe. Those in whom we are so deeply
interested, felt at once subdued and elevated; and as they
quitted the darkening fabric, through which the pealing
tones of the organ were yet reverberating, they could not
help inquiring, should they ever enter it again,&mdash;and in
what altered circumstances might it be?</p>

<p>To return, however&mdash;though it is, indeed, like descending
from the holy mountain into the bustle and hubbub
of the city at its foot&mdash;Mr. Parkinson, being most unexpectedly,
and as he felt it unfortunately, summoned to
Grilston that afternoon, in order to send up some deeds of
a distinguished client to London, for the purpose of immediately
effecting a mortgage, set off in a post-chaise, at
top-speed, in a very unenviable frame of mind; and by
seven o'clock was seated in his office at Grilston, busily
turning over a great number of deeds and papers, in a
large tin case, with the words "Right Honorable the Earl
of Yelverton" painted on the outside. Having turned
over almost everything inside, and found all that he
wanted, he was going to toss back again all the deeds
which were not requisite for his immediate purpose, when
he happened to see one lying at the very bottom which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
had not before observed. It was not a large, but an old
deed&mdash;and he took it up and hastily examined it.</p>

<p>We have seen a piece of unexpected good-fortune on
the part of Gammon and his client; and the reader will
not be disappointed at finding something of a similar kind
befalling Mr. Aubrey, even at the eleventh hour. Mr.
Parkinson's journey, which he had execrated a hundred
times over as he came down, produced a discovery which
made him tremble all over with agitation and delighted
excitement, and begin to look upon it as almost owing to
an interference of Providence. The deed which he looked
at, bore an indorsement of the name of "<i>Dreddlington</i>."
After a hasty glance over its contents, he tried to recollect
by what accident a document, belonging to Mr.
Aubrey, could have found its way into the box containing
Lord Yelverton's deeds; and it at length occurred to him
that, some time before, Mr. Aubrey had proposed advancing
several thousand pounds to Lord Yelverton, on mortgage
of a small portion of his Lordship's property&mdash;but
which negotiation had afterwards been broken off; that
Mr. Aubrey's title-deeds happened to be at the same time
open and loose in his office&mdash;and he recollected having
considerable trouble in separating the respective documents
which had got mixed together. This one, after all,
had been by some accident overlooked, till it turned up
in this most timely and extraordinary manner! Having
hastily effected the object which had brought him back
to Grilston, he ordered a post-chaise and four, and within
a quarter of an hour was thundering back, at top-speed,
on his way to York, which, the horses reeking and foaming,
he reached a little after ten o'clock. He jumped out,
with the precious deed in his pocket, the instant that his
chaise-door was opened, and ran off, without saying more
than&mdash;"I'm gone to the Attorney-General's." This was
heard by many passers-by and persons standing round;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
and it spread far and wide that something of the utmost
importance had transpired, with reference to the great
ejectment cause of Mr. Aubrey. Soon afterwards, messengers
and clerks, belonging to Mr. Runnington and Mr.
Parkinson, were to be seen running to and fro, summoning
Mr. Sterling, Mr. Crystal, Mr. Mansfield, and also Mr.
Aubrey, to a second consultation at the Attorney-General's.
About eleven o'clock they were all assembled. The deed
which had occasioned all this excitement, was one calculated
indeed to produce that effect; and it filled the
minds of all present with astonishment and delight. It
was, in a word, a <span class="smcap">deed of confirmation</span> by
<span class="smcap">old Dreddlington</span>, the father of Harry Dreddlington, of the
conveyance by the latter to Geoffrey Dreddlington, who, in
the manner already mentioned to the reader, had got
an assignment of that conveyance to himself. After the
Attorney-General had satisfied himself as to the account
to be given of the deed&mdash;the custody whence it came,
namely, the attorney for the defendant; Mr. Parkinson
undertaking to swear, without any hesitation, that whatever
deeds of Mr. Aubrey's he possessed, he had taken
from the muniment room at Yatton&mdash;the second consultation
broke up. Mr. Aubrey, on hearing the nature and
effect of the instrument explained by the Attorney-General
and Mr. Mansfield&mdash;all his counsel, in short, concurring
in opinion as to the triumphant effect which this instrument
would produce on the morrow&mdash;may be pardoned
for regarding it, in the excitement of the moment, as
almost a direct interference of Providence.</p>

<p>A few minutes before nine o'clock on the ensuing morning,
the occasional shrill blasts of the trumpets announced
that the judges were on their way to the Castle, the approaches
to which were crowded with carriages and pedestrians
of a highly respectable appearance. As the Castle
clock finished striking nine, Lord Widdrington, in a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
wig and plain black silk gown,[<a href='#Note_31'>31</a>] took his seat, and the
swearing of the special jury commenced. The court was
crowded almost to suffocation; all the chief places being
filled with persons of distinction in the county. The
benches on each side of the judge were occupied by ladies,
who&mdash;especially the Countess of Oldacre and Lady De
la Zouch&mdash;evinced a painful degree of anxiety and excitement
in their countenances and demeanor. The bar
also mustered in great force; the crown court being quite
deserted, although "a great murder case" was going on
there. The civil court was on the present occasion the
point of attraction, not only on account of the interesting
nature of the case to be tried, but of the keen contest
expected between the Attorney-General and Mr. Subtle.
The former, as he entered&mdash;his commanding features
gazed at by many an anxious eye with hope, and a feeling
that on his skill and learning depended that day the destination
of the Yatton property&mdash;bowed to the judge,
and then nodded and shook hands with several of the
counsel nearest to him; then he sat down, and his clerk
having opened his bags, and taken out his huge brief, he
began turning over its leaves with a calm and attentive
air, occasionally conversing with his juniors. Every one
present observed that the defendant's counsel and attorneys
wore the confident looks of winning men; while
their opponents, quick-sighted enough, also observed the
circumstance, and looked, on that account alone, a shade
more anxious than when they had entered the court.
Mr. Subtle requested Gammon, whose ability he had soon
detected, to sit immediately beneath him; next to Gammon
sat Quirk; then Snap; and beside him Mr. Titmouse,
with a staring sky-blue flowered silk handkerchief
round his neck, a gaudy waistcoat, a tight surtout, and
white kid gloves. He looked exceedingly pale, and dared
hardly interchange a word with even Snap, who was just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
as irritable and excited as his senior partners. It was
quickly known all over the court which was Titmouse!
Mr. Aubrey scarcely showed himself in court all day,
though he stood at the door near the bench, and could
hear all that passed; Lord De la Zouch and one or two
other personal friends standing with him, engaged, from
time to time, in anxious conversation.</p>

<p>The jury having been sworn, Mr. Lynx rose, and in a
few hurried sentences, to the lay audience utterly unintelligible,
intimated the nature of the pleadings in the
cause. The Attorney-General then in a low tone requested
that all the witnesses might leave the court.[<a href='#Note_32'>32</a>] As soon
as the little disturbance occasioned by this move had
ceased, Mr. Subtle rose, and in a low but distinct tone
said, "May it please your Lordship&mdash;Gentlemen of the
Jury,&mdash;In this cause I have the honor to appear before
you as counsel for the plaintiff; and it now becomes my
duty to state as briefly as I can, the nature of his case.
It is impossible, gentlemen, that we should not be aware
of the unusual interest excited by this cause; and which
may be accounted for by the very large estates in this
county which are sought this day to be transferred to a
comparative stranger, from the family who have long enjoyed
them, and of whom I am anxious to say everything
respectful; for you will very soon find that the name on
the record is that of only the nominal defendant; and although
all that is <i>professed</i> to be this day sought to be
recovered is a very trifling portion of the property, your
verdict will undoubtedly in effect decide the question as
to the true ownership and enjoyment of the large estates
now held by the gentleman who is the substantial defendant&mdash;I
mean Mr. Aubrey, the member of Parliament for
the borough of Yatton; for whatever answer he might
make to an action brought to recover his whole estate,
he must make upon the present occasion." Aware of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
watchful and formidable opponent who would in due time
answer him, and also of being himself entitled to the
general reply&mdash;to the last word&mdash;Mr. Subtle proceeded
to state the nature of the plaintiff's case with the utmost
brevity and clearness. Scarcely any sound was heard but
that of the pens of the short-hand writers, and of the
counsel taking their notes. Mr. Subtle, having handed
up two or three copies of the pedigree which he held in
his hand to the judge, the jury, and his opponents, pointed
out with distinctness and precision every link in the chain
of evidence which he intended to lay before the jury; and
having done this&mdash;having presented as few salient points
of attack to his opponent as he possibly could&mdash;he sat
down, professing his entire ignorance of what case could
be set up in answer to that which he had opened. He
had not been on his legs quite half an hour; and when
he ceased&mdash;how he had disappointed every one present,
except the judge and the bar! Instead of a speech apparently
befitting so great an occasion&mdash;impressive and
eloquent&mdash;here had been a brief dry statement of a few
uninteresting facts&mdash;of dates, of births, deaths, marriages,
registers, entries, inscriptions, deeds, wills&mdash;without
a single touch of feeling, or ray of eloquence. The
momentary feeling of disappointment in the audience,
however&mdash;almost all of whom, it may easily be believed,
were in the interest of the Aubreys&mdash;quickly yielded to
one of satisfaction and relief; as they thought they might
regard so meagre a speech as heralding as meagre a case.
As soon as he had sat down, Mr. Quicksilver rose and
called the first witness. "We're safe!" said the Attorney-General
to Mr. Sterling and Mr. Crystal, with his hand
before his mouth, and with the very faintest whisper that
could be audible to those whom he addressed; and the
witness having been sworn, they all resumed their seats
and their writing. The first and the subsequent witness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
established one or two preliminary and formal points&mdash;the
Attorney-General scarcely rising to put a question to
them. The third witness was examined by Mr. Subtle
with apparent unconcern, but really with exquisite anxiety.
From the earnestness and attention with which the
words of the witness were watched and taken down by
both the judge and the counsel, who knew somewhat
better than the audience where the strain of the case
commenced, it must have appeared to the latter, that
either Mr. Subtle under-estimated, or his opponents over-estimated,
the value of the evidence now in process of
being extracted by Mr. Subtle, in short, easy, pointed
questions, and with a bland and smiling countenance.</p>

<p>"Not so fast, sir," gruffly interposed Lord Widdrington,
addressing the witness.</p>

<p>"Take time, Mr. Jones," said Mr. Subtle, kindly, fearful
of ruffling or discomposing an important witness.
The Attorney-General rose to cross-examine; pressed him
quietly but closely; varied the shape of his questions;
now he soothed, then he startled by his sternness; but sat
down, evidently having produced no impression. Thus it
was with one or two succeeding witnesses; the Attorney-General,
on each occasion, resuming his seat after his
abortive efforts with perfect composure. At length, however,
by a very admirable and well-sustained fire of cross-questioning,
he completely demolished a material witness;
and the hopes of all interested in behalf of his clients rose
high. Mr. Subtle, who had been all the while paring his
nails, and from time to time smiling with a careless air,
(though you might as safely have touched a tigress suckling
her cubs as attempted at that moment to disturb
him, so absorbed was he in intense anxiety,) believing
that he could establish the same facts by another and, as
he thought, a better witness, did not re-examine; but
calling that other, with an air of nonchalance, succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
in extracting from him all that the former had failed in;
baffling all the attempts of the Attorney-General to affect
his credit. At length, another witness being in the box,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I object, my Lord, to that question," said Mr. Attorney-General,
as Mr. Subtle, amid many indifferent and
apparently irrelevant questions, quietly slipped in one of
the greatest possible importance and advantage to him&mdash;had
it been answered as he desired. 'T&nbsp;was quite delightful
to see the Attorney-General and his experienced and
watchful juniors all rise at one and the same instant:
showing how vain were the tricks and ingenuity of their
sly opponent. Mr. Attorney-General stated his objection
briefly and pointedly; Mr. Subtle answered him, followed
by Quicksilver and Lynx; and then Mr. Attorney-General
replied, with great force and clearness. This keen encounter
of their wits over&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall allow the question to be put," said Lord Widdrington,
after a pause&mdash;"But I have great doubts as to
its propriety. I will therefore take a note of Mr. Attorney-General's
objection." Four or five similar conflicts arose
during the course of the plaintiff's case:&mdash;now concerning
the competency of a witness&mdash;then as to the admissibility
of a document, or the propriety of a particular
question. On each of these occasions there were displayed
on both sides consummate logical skill and acuteness,
especially by the two leaders. Distinctions, the
most delicate and subtle, were suggested with suddenness,
and as promptly encountered; the most artful man&oelig;uvres
to secure dangerous admissions resorted to, and baffled;
the most recondite principles of evidence brought to bear
with admirable readiness on both sides. To deal with
them, required, indeed, the practised, penetrating, and
powerful intellect of Lord Widdrington. Some points he
disposed of promptly to the satisfaction of both parties;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
on others he hesitated, and at length reserved them.
Though none but the more experienced and able members
of the bar could in the least degree enter into and appreciate
the nature of these conflicts, they were watched with
untiring attention and eagerness by all present, both ladies
and gentlemen&mdash;by the lowly and the distinguished.
And though the intensity of the feelings of all was manifest
by a mere glimpse round the court, yet any momentary
display of eccentricity on the part of a witness, or
of petulance or repartee on the part of counsel, would occasion
a momentary merriment which, in point of fact,
served only as a sort of <i>relief</i> to the strained feelings of
the audience, and instantly disappeared. The tombstone
part of the case was got through easily; scarcely any attempt
being made on the part of Mr. Aubrey's counsel to
resist or interfere with it. But the great&mdash;the hottest
part of the fight&mdash;occurred at that point of the case,
where Titmouse's descent from Stephen Dreddlington was
sought to be established. This gentleman, who had been
a very wild person, whose movements were very difficult
to be traced or accounted for, had entered the navy, and
ultimately died at sea, as had always been imagined,
single and childless. It was proved, however, that so
far from such being the case, he had married a person
at Portsmouth, of inferior station, and that by her he
had a daughter, only two years before his death. Both
mother and daughter, after undergoing great privation,
and no notice being taken of the mother by any of her
late husband's family, removed to the house of a humble
and distant relative in Cumberland, where the mother
afterwards died, leaving her daughter only fifteen years
old. When she grew up, she lived in some menial capacity
in Cumberland, and ultimately married one Gabriel
Tittlebat Titmouse; who, after living for some years a
cordwainer at Whitehaven, found his way to Grilston, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
Yorkshire, in the neighborhood of which town he had lived
for some years in very humble circumstances. There he
had married; and about two years afterwards his wife
died, leaving a son&mdash;our friend Tittlebat Titmouse. Both
of them afterwards came to London: where, in four or
five years' time, the father died, leaving the little Titmouse
to flutter and hop about in the wide world as best
he could. During the whole of this part of the case, Mr.
Gammon had evinced deep anxiety; and at a particular
point&mdash;perhaps the crisis&mdash;his agitation was excessive;
yet it was almost entirely concealed by his remarkable
self-control. The little documentary evidence of which
Gammon, at his first interview with Titmouse, found him
possessed, proved at the trial, as Gammon had foreseen,
of great importance. The evidence in support of this
part of the case, and which it took till two o'clock on the
ensuing afternoon to get through, was subjected to a
most determined and skilful opposition by the Attorney-General,
but in vain. The case had been got up with
the utmost care, under the excellent management of
Lynx; and Mr. Subtle's consummate tact and ability
brought it, at length, fully and distinctly out before
the jury.</p>

<p>"That, my Lord," said he, as he sat down after re-examining
his last witness, "is the case on the part of
the plaintiff." On this the judge and jury withdrew, for
a short time, to obtain refreshment. During their absence,
the Attorney-General, Mr. Sterling, Mr. Crystal, and
Mr. Mansfield, might have been seen, with their heads
all laid close together, engaged in anxious consultation&mdash;a
group gazed at by the eager eyes of many a spectator,
whose beating heart wished their cause godspeed. The
Attorney-General then withdrew for a few moments, also
to seek refreshment; and returning at the same time with
the judge, after a moment's pause rose, bowed to the judge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
then to the jury, and opened the defendant's case. His
manner was calm and impressive; his person was dignified;
and his clear, distinct voice fell on the listening
ear like the sound of silver. After a graceful allusion
to the distinguished character of his friend and client,
Mr. Aubrey, (to whose eminent position in the House of
Commons he bore his personal testimony,) to the magnitude
of the interests now at stake, and the extraordinary
nature of the claim set up, he proceeded: "On every
account, therefore, I feel sensible, gentlemen, to an unusual
and most painful extent, of the very great responsibility
now resting upon my learned friends and myself;
lest any miscarriage of mine should prejudice in any degree
the important interests committed to us, or impair
the strength of the case which I am about to submit to
you on the part of Mr. Aubrey; a case which, I assure
you, unless some extraordinary mischance should befall
us, will, I believe, annihilate that which, with so much
pains, so much tact, and so much ability, has just been laid
before you by my learned friend Mr. Subtle; and establish
the defendant in the safe possession of that large property
which is the subject of the present most extraordinary
and unexpected litigation. But, gentlemen, before proceeding
so far as that, it is fitting that I should call your attention
to the nature of the case set up on the part of the
plaintiff, and the sort of evidence by which it has been attempted
to be supported; and I am very sanguine of being
successful in showing you that the plaintiff's witnesses are
not entitled to the credit to which they lay claim; and,
consequently, that there is no case made out for the defendant
to answer." He then entered into a rigorous analysis
of the plaintiff's evidence, contrasting each conflicting
portion with the other, with singular cogency; and commenting
with powerful severity upon the demeanor and
character of many of the witnesses. On proceeding, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
length, to open the case of the defendant&mdash;"And here,
gentlemen," said he, "I am reminded of the observation
with which my learned friend concluded&mdash;that he was
entirely ignorant of the case which we meant to set up
in answer to that which he had opened on the part of the
plaintiff. Gentlemen, it would have been curious, indeed,
had it been otherwise&mdash;had my friend's penetrating eye
been able to inspect the contents of my client's strong-box&mdash;and
so become acquainted with the evidence on
which he rests his title to the property now in dispute.
My learned friend has, however, succeeded in entitling
himself to information on that point; and he shall have
it&mdash;and to his heart's content." Here Mr. Subtle cast
a glance of smiling incredulity towards the jury, and defiance
towards the Attorney-General. He took his pen
into his hand, however, and his juniors looked very anxious.
"Gentlemen," continued the Attorney-General, "I
am ready to concede to my learned friend every inch of
the case which he has been endeavoring to make out;
that he has completely established his pedigree.&mdash;At all
events, I am ready to concede this for the purpose of the
case which is now under discussion before you." He then
mentioned the conveyance by Harry Dreddlington of all
his interest&mdash;&mdash;"You forget that he died in his father's
lifetime, Mr. Attorney-General," interposed Mr. Subtle,
with a placid smile, and the air of a man who is suddenly
relieved from a vast pressure of anxiety.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, gentlemen, not a bit of it&mdash;'tis a
part of my case. My learned friend is quite right; Harry
Dreddlington <i>did</i> die in his father's lifetime:&mdash;but"&mdash;&mdash; Here
Mr. Subtle gazed at the Attorney-General with unaffected
curiosity; and when the latter came to mention
"the <i>Deed of Confirmation</i> by <span class="smcap">the father</span> of Harry
Dreddlington," an acute observer might have observed a
slight change of color in Mr. Subtle. Lynx looked at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
Attorney-General as if he expected every instant to receive
a musket-ball in his breast!</p>

<p>"What, '<i>confirm</i>' a <span class="smcap">nullity</span>, Mr. Attorney-General?"
interrupted Mr. Subtle, laying down his pen with a smile
of derision; but a moment or two afterwards, "Mr. Mortmain,"
said he, in a hasty whisper, "what do you think of
this? Tell me&mdash;in four words"&mdash;Mortmain, his eye
glued to the face of the Attorney-General the while, muttered
hastily something about "<i>operating as a new grant</i>&mdash;<i>as
a new conveyance</i>."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! I mean what's the <i>answer</i> to the Attorney-General?"
muttered Mr. Subtle, impatiently; but his
countenance preserved its expression of smiling nonchalance.
"You will oblige me, Mr. Mortmain," he by-and-by
whispered in a quiet but peremptory tone, "by giving
your utmost attention to the question as to the effect of
this deed&mdash;so that I may shape my objection to it properly
when it is tendered in evidence. If it really have
the legal effect attributed to it, and which I suspect it
really to have, we may as well shut up our briefs. I
<i>thought</i> there must be some such cursed point or other
in the background!"</p>

<p>Gammon saw the real state of Mr. Subtle's mind, and
his cheek turned pale, but he preserved a smile on his
countenance, as he sat with his arms folded. Quirk eyed
him with undisguised agitation, scarce daring to look up
at Mr. Subtle. Titmouse, seeing a little dismay in his
camp, turned very white and cold, and sat still, scarce
daring to breathe; while Snap looked like a terrier consciously
going to have its teeth pulled out!</p>

<p>At length the Attorney-General, after stating that, in
addition to the case which he had intimated, as resting
mainly on the deed of confirmation, he should proceed to
prove the pedigree of Mr. Aubrey, sat down, having spoken
about two hours and a half, expressing his conviction that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
when the defendant's evidence should have been closed,
the jury, under his Lordship's direction, would return a
verdict for the defendant; and that, too, without leaving
the jury-box, where, by their long and patient attention,
they had so honorably acquitted themselves of the important
duty imposed upon them by the constitution.</p>

<p>"James Parkinson!" exclaimed Mr. Sterling, quietly
but distinctly, as the Attorney-General sat down. "You
are the attorney for the defendant?" inquired Mr.
Sterling, as soon as the witness had been sworn. "Do
you produce a conveyance between Harry Dreddlington
and Moses Aaron?" &amp;c. (specifying it.) It was proved
and put in, without much opposition. So also was another&mdash;the
assignment from Moses Aaron to Geoffrey Dreddlington.</p>

<p>"Do you also produce a deed between Harry Dreddlington
the elder and Geoffrey Dreddlington?" and he mentioned
the date and names of all the parties to the deed
of confirmation. Mr. Parkinson handed in the important document.</p>

<p>"Stay, stay; where did you get that deed, Mr. Parkinson?"
inquired Mr. Subtle, sharply, extending his hand
for the deed.</p>

<p>"From my office at Grilston, where I keep many of
Mr. Aubrey's title-deeds."</p>

<p>"When did you bring it hither?"</p>

<p>"About ten o'clock last night, for the purpose of this trial."</p>

<p>"How long has it been at your office?"</p>

<p>"Ever since I fetched it, a year or two ago, with other
deeds from the muniment room of Yatton Hall."</p>

<p>"How long have you been solicitor to Mr. Aubrey?"</p>

<p>"For this ten years; and my father was solicitor to his
father for twenty-five years."</p>

<p>"Will you swear that this deed was in your office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
before the proceedings in this action were brought to
your notice?"</p>

<p>"I have not the slightest doubt in the world."</p>

<p>"That does not satisfy me, sir. Will you <i>swear</i> that
it was?"</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i>, sir," replied Mr. Parkinson, firmly. "It never
attracted any more notice from me than any other of
Mr. Aubrey's deeds, till my attention was drawn to it
in consequence of these proceedings."</p>

<p>"Has any one access to Mr. Aubrey's deeds at your
office but yourself?"</p>

<p>"None that I know of; I keep all the deeds of my
clients which are at my office, in their respective boxes;
and allow no one access to them, except under my immediate
notice, and in my presence."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Subtle sat down.</p>

<p>"My Lord, we now propose to put in this deed," said
the Attorney-General, unfolding it.</p>

<p>"Allow me to look at it, Mr. Attorney," said Mr.
Subtle. It was handed to him; and he, his juniors, and
Mr. Mortmain, rising up, were engaged most anxiously
in scrutinizing it for some minutes. Mortmain having
looked at the stamp, sat down, and opening his bag,
hastily drew out an old well-worn volume which contained
all the stamp acts that had ever been passed from
the time of William the Third, when, I believe, the first
of those blessings was conferred upon this country. First
he looked at the deed&mdash;then at his book&mdash;then at the
deed again; and at length might be seen, with earnest
gestures, putting Mr. Subtle in possession of some opinion
which he had formed on the subject. "My Lord,"
said Mr. Subtle, after a pause, "I object to this instrument
being received in evidence, on account of the
insufficiency of the stamp." This produced quite a
sensation in court. Mr. Subtle then proceeded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
mention the character of the stamp affixed to the deed, and
read the act which was in force at the time that the deed
bore date; and, after a few additional observations, sat
down, and was followed by Mr. Quicksilver and Mr. Lynx.
Then arose the Attorney-General, having in the mean time
carefully looked at the act of Parliament, and submitted
to his Lordship that the stamp was sufficient; being
followed by his juniors. Mr. Subtle replied at some length.</p>

<p>"I certainly entertain some difficulty on the point,"
said his Lordship, "and will mention the matter to my
brother Grayley." Taking with him the deed, and Mr.
Mortmain's copy of the stamp acts, his Lordship left the
court, and was absent a quarter of an hour&mdash;half an hour&mdash;three
quarters of an hour; and at length returned.</p>

<p>"I have consulted," said his Lordship, as soon as he
had taken his seat amid the profoundest silence, "my
brother Grayley, and we have very fully considered the
point. My brother happens, fortunately, to have by him
a manuscript note of a case in which he was counsel,
about eighteen years ago, and in which the exact point
arose which exists in the present case." He then read
out of a thick manuscript book, which he had brought
with him from Mr. Justice Grayley, the particulars of the
case alluded to, and which were certainly almost precisely
similar to those then before the court. In the case referred
to, the stamp had been held sufficient; and so,
his Lordship and his brother Grayley were of opinion, was
the stamp in the deed then before him. The cloud which
had settled upon the countenances of the Attorney-General
and his party, here flitted over to, and settled upon,
those of his opponents. "Your Lordship will perhaps
take a note of the objection," said Mr. Subtle, somewhat
chagrined. Lord Widdrington nodded, and immediately
made the requisite entry in his notes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Now</i>, then, we propose to put in and read this deed,"
said the Attorney-General, with a smile of suppressed
triumph, holding out his hand towards Mr. Lynx, who
was scrutinizing it very eagerly&mdash;"I presume my
learned friend will require only the operative parts to
be read"&mdash;here Lynx, with some excitement, called
his leader's attention to something which had occurred
to him in the deed: up got Quicksilver and Mortmain;
and presently&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not quite so fast, Mr. Attorney, if you please," said
Mr. Subtle, with a little elation of manner&mdash;"I have
another, and I apprehend a clearly fatal objection to the
admissibility of this deed, till my learned friend shall have
accounted for an <span class="smcap">erasure</span>"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Erasure!" echoed the Attorney-General, with much
surprise&mdash;"Allow me to see the deed;" and he took it
with an incredulous smile, which, however, disappeared
as he looked more and more closely at the instrument;
Mr. Sterling, Mr. Crystal, and Mr. Mansfield also looking
extremely serious.</p>

<p>"I've hit them <i>now</i>," said Mr. Subtle to those behind
him, as he leaned back, and looked with no little triumph
at his opponents&mdash;"<i>Was</i> there ever anything so lucky in
this world before?" From what apparently inadequate
and trifling causes often flow great results! The plain
fact of the case was merely this. The attorney's clerk,
in copying out the deed, which was one of considerable
length, had written eight or ten words by mistake; and
fearing to exasperate his master, by rendering necessary
a new deed and stamp, and occasioning trouble and delay,
had neatly scratched out the erroneous words, and over
the erasure written the correct ones. As he was the
party who was intrusted with seeing to and witnessing
the execution of the instrument, he of course took no
notice of the alteration, and&mdash;see the result! The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
ownership of an estate of ten thousand a-year about to
turn upon the effect of this erasure!</p>

<p>"Hand me up the deed," said the judge; and inspected
it minutely for a minute or two, holding it up,
once or twice, to the light.</p>

<p>"Has any one a magnifying-glass in court?" inquired
the Attorney-General, with a look of increasing anxiety.
No one happened to have one.</p>

<p>"Is it necessary, Mr. Attorney?" said Lord Widdrington,
handing down the instrument to him with an
ominous look.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you object, of course, Mr. Subtle&mdash;as I
understand you&mdash;that this deed is void, on account
of an erasure in a material part of it?" inquired Lord Widdrington.</p>

<p>"That is my objection, my Lord," said Mr. Subtle,
sitting down.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Attorney," continued the judge, turning to
the Attorney-General, prepared to take a note of any observations
which he might offer. The spectators&mdash;the
whole court&mdash;were aware that the great crisis of the
case had arrived; and there was a sickening silence.
The Attorney-General, with perfect calmness and self-possession,
immediately addressed the court in answer to
this very critical and unexpected objection. That there
<i>was</i> an erasure, which, owing to the hurry with which
the instrument had been examined, had been overlooked,
was indisputable. The Attorney-General's argument was,
first, that the erasure was in a part not material; secondly,
that even if in a material part of the deed, it would not
be avoided, but the alteration would be presumed to have
taken place before the execution of the deed.[<a href='#Note_33'>33</a>] It was
easy to see that he spoke with the air of a man who
argues <i>contra spem</i>. What he said, however, was pertinent
and forcible; the same might be said of Mr. Sterling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
and Mr. Crystal; but they were all plainly <i>gravelled</i>.
Mr. Subtle replied with cruel cogency.</p>

<p>"Well," said Lord Widdrington, when Mr. Subtle had
concluded, "I own I feel scarcely any doubt upon the
matter; but as it is certainly of the greatest possible importance
in the present case, I will just see how it strikes
my brother Grayley." With this he took the deed in his
hand and quitted the court. He touched Mr. Aubrey, in
passing to his private room, holding the deed before him!
After an absence of about ten minutes, Lord Widdrington returned.</p>

<p>"Silence! silence there!" bawled the crier; and the
bustle had soon subsided into profound silence.</p>

<p>"I think, and my brother Grayley agrees with me,"
said Lord Widdrington, "that I ought not to receive this
deed in evidence, unless the erasure occurring in an essential
part of it be first accounted for. Unless, therefore,
you are prepared, Mr. Attorney, with any evidence of
that kind, I shall not receive the deed." The Attorney-General
bowed, in silence, to his Lordship.</p>

<p>There was a faint buzz all over the court&mdash;a buzz of
excitement, anxiety, and disappointment; during which
the Attorney-General consulted for a moment or two with
his juniors.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly, my Lord," said he at length, "we are
not prepared with any evidence to explain a circumstance
which has taken us entirely by surprise. After this
length of time, my Lord, of course"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;it is a great misfortune for the parties&mdash;a
great misfortune. Of course you tender the deed in
evidence?" he continued, taking a note.</p>

<p>"We do, my Lord, certainly," replied the Attorney-General;
and sitting down, he and his juniors took a note
of the decision; Lord Widdrington and the Attorney-General's
opponents doing the same.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span></p>

<p>You should have seen the faces of Messrs. Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap, as they looked at Mr. Parkinson, with an
agitated air, returning the rejected deed to the bag from
which it had been lately taken with so confident and triumphant
an air!&mdash;The remainder of the case, which had
been opened by the Attorney-General on behalf of Mr.
Aubrey, was then proceeded with; but in spite of all
their assumed calmness, the disappointment and distress
of his counsel were perceptible to all. They were now
dejected&mdash;they felt that the cause was lost, unless
some extraordinary good fortune should yet befall them.
They were not long in establishing the descent of Mr.
Aubrey from Geoffrey Dreddlington. It was necessary
to do so; for grievously as they had been disappointed
in failing to establish the title paramount, founded upon
the deed of confirmation of Mr. Aubrey, it was yet an
important question for the jury, whether they believed
the evidence adduced by the plaintiff to show title in himself.</p>

<p>"That, my Lord, is the defendant's case," said the
Attorney-General as his last witness left the box; and
Mr. Subtle then rose to reply. He felt how unpopular
was his cause; that almost every countenance around him
bore a hostile expression. Privately, he loathed his case,
when he saw the sort of person for whom he was struggling.
All his sympathies (he was a very proud, haughty
man) were on behalf of Mr. Aubrey, whom by name and
reputation he well knew, and with whom he had often sat
in the House of Commons. Now, conspicuous before him,
sat his little monkey-client, Titmouse&mdash;a ridiculous object;
and calculated, if there were any scope for the influence
of prejudice, to ruin his own cause by the exhibition
of himself before the jury. That was the vulgar idiot
who was to turn the admirable Aubreys out of Yatton,
and send them beggared into the world! But Mr. Subtle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
was a high-minded English advocate; and if he had seen
Miss Aubrey in all her loveliness, and knew that her
<i>all</i> depended upon the success of his exertions, he could
hardly have exerted himself more strenuously than he did
on the present occasion. And such, at length, was the
effect which that exquisitely skilful advocate produced,
in his address to the jury, that he began to bring about a
change in the feelings of most around him; even the eye
of scornful beauty began to direct fewer glances of indignation
and disgust upon Titmouse, as Mr. Subtle's irresistible
rhetoric drew upon their sympathies in that young
gentleman's behalf. "My learned friend, the Attorney-General,
gentlemen, dropped one or two expressions of a
somewhat disparaging tendency," said Mr. Subtle, "in alluding
to my client, Mr. Titmouse; and shadowed forth
a disadvantageous contrast between the obscure and ignorant
plaintiff, and the gifted defendant. Good heavens,
gentlemen! and is my humble client's misfortune to become
his fault? If he be obscure and ignorant, unacquainted
with the usages of society, deprived of the
blessings of a superior education&mdash;if he have contracted
vulgarity, <i>whose fault is it</i>?&mdash;Who has occasioned it?
Who plunged him and his parents before him into an unjust
poverty and obscurity, from which Providence is
about this day to rescue him, and put him in possession
of his own? Gentlemen, if topics like these must be introduced
into this case, I ask you <i>who is accountable</i> for
the present condition of my unfortunate client? Is he,
or are those who have been, perhaps unconsciously, but
still unjustly, so long revelling in the wealth which is his?
Gentlemen, in the name of everything that is manly and
generous, I challenge your sympathy, your commiseration,
for my client." Here Titmouse, who had been staring
open-mouthed for some time at his eloquent advocate, and
could be kept quiet no longer by the most vehement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
efforts of Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, rose up in an
excited manner, exclaiming, "Bravo! bravo, bravo, sir!
'Pon my life, capital! It's quite true&mdash;bravo! bravo!"
His astounded advocate paused at this unprecedented
interruption. "Take the puppy out of court, sir, or I
will not utter one word more," said he, in a fierce whisper
to Mr. Gammon.</p>

<p>"Who is that? Leave the court, sir! Your conduct
is most indecent, sir! I have a great mind to commit
you, sir!" said Lord Widdrington, directing an awful
look down to the offender, who had turned of a ghastly whiteness.</p>

<p>"Have mercy upon me, my Lord! I'll never do it
again," he groaned, clasping his hands, and verily believing
that Lord Widdrington was going to take the
estate away from him.</p>

<p>Snap at length succeeded in getting him out of court,
and after the excitement occasioned by this irregular
interruption had subsided, Mr. Subtle resumed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said he, in a low tone, "I perceive that
you are moved by this little incident; and it is characteristic
of your superior feelings. Inferior persons, destitute
of sensibility or refinement, might have smiled at eccentricities,
which occasion gentlemen like yourselves only
feelings of greater commiseration. I protest, gentlemen"&mdash;&mdash; his
voice trembled for a moment, but he soon resumed
his self-possession; and, after a long and admirable
address, sat down, confident of the verdict.</p>

<p>"If we lose the verdict, sir," said he, bending down and
whispering into the ear of Gammon, "we may thank that
execrable little puppy for it." Gammon changed color,
but made no reply.</p>

<p>Lord Widdrington then commenced summing up the
case to the jury with his usual care and perspicacity.
Nothing could be more beautiful than the ease with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
which he extricated the facts of the case from the
meshes in which they had been alternately involved by
Mr. Subtle and the Attorney-General. As soon as he
had explained to them the general principles of law applicable
to the case, he placed before them the facts
proved by the plaintiff, and then the answer of the defendant:
every one in court trembling for the result, if
the jury should take the same view which he felt compelled
himself to take. The judge suggested that they
should retire to consider the case, taking with them the
pedigrees which had been handed in to them; and added
that, if they should require his assistance, he should remain
in his private room for an hour or two. Both
judge and jury then retired, it being about eight o'clock.
Candles were lit in the court, which continued crowded to
suffocation. Few doubted which way the verdict would
go. Fatigued as must have been most of the spectators
with a two days' confinement and excitement,&mdash;ladies
as well as gentlemen,&mdash;scarce a person thought of
quitting before the verdict had been pronounced. After
an hour and a half's absence, a cry was heard from the
bailiff in whose charge the jury had retired&mdash;"Clear
the way for the jury;" and one or two officers, with
their wands, obeyed the directions. As the jury were
re-entering their box, struggling with a little difficulty
through the crowd, Lord Widdrington resumed his seat
upon the bench.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the jury, have the goodness," said the
associate, "to answer to your names.&mdash;<i>Sir Godolphin
Fitzherbert</i>"&mdash;&mdash; and, while their names were thus called
over, all the counsel took their pens, and, turning over
their briefs with an air of anxiety, prepared to indorse on
them the verdict. As soon as all the jurymen had answered,
a profound silence ensued.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the jury," inquired the associate, "are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
you agreed upon your verdict? Do you find for the
plaintiff, or for the defendant?"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">For the plaintiff</span>," replied the foreman; on which
the officer, amid a kind of blank dismayed silence, making
at the same time some hieroglyphics upon the record,
muttered&mdash;"<i>Verdict for the Plaintiff.&mdash;Damages, one
shilling. Costs, forty shillings</i>;" while another functionary
bawled out, amid the increasing buzz in the
court, "Have the goodness to wait, gentlemen of the
jury. You will be paid immediately." Whereupon, to
the disgust and indignation of the unlearned spectators,
and the astonishment of some of the gentlemen of the
jury themselves&mdash;many of them the very first men of
the county&mdash;Snap jumped up on the form, pulled out
his purse with an air of wild exultation, and proceeded to
remunerate Sir Godolphin Fitzherbert and his companions
with the sum of two guineas each. Proclamation was then
made, and the court adjourned till the next morning.</p>

<p>So much curiosity has been excited among lay readers in this
country and in America, and also among professional persons in
France and Germany, as to the real nature of the species of action
mentioned in the text, that the author is induced here to give some
further account of a matter which enters so considerably into the
construction of this story. The action of Ejectment is described
with minute accuracy in the text; has been in existence for at least
five hundred years, (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> since the close of Edward II., or beginning
of Edward III., A. D. 1327;) and its venerable but tortuous fiction
has been scarcely even touched by the "amending hand," which
lately (1834) cut away so many cumbrous, complicated, and <i>quasi</i>
obsolete portions of the law of action, (see Stat. 3 and 4 Will. 4,
c. 27, § 36.) The progress of this action is calculated to throw
much light on some of our early history and jurisprudence. See an
interesting sketch of it in the first chapter of Mr. Sergeant Adams'
Treatise on Ejectment. It was resorted to for the purpose of escaping
from the other dilatory, intricate, and expensive modes of
recovering landed property anciently in existence. The following
is the description given of it by Lord Mansfield&mdash;and is equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
terse and correct, and applicable to the present mode of procedure.
"An <span class="smcap">Ejectment</span> is an ingenious <i>fiction</i> for the Trial of Titles to
the possession of Land. In <i>form</i> it is a trick between two, to dispossess
a third by a sham suit and judgment. The artifice would
be criminal, unless the <i>Court</i> converted it into a <i>fair</i> trial with the
<i>proper</i> party. The control the Court have over the judgment
against the Casual Ejector, enables them to put any <i>terms</i> upon
the plaintiff which are <i>just</i>. He was soon ordered to give <i>notice</i>
to the <i>tenant in possession</i>. When the tenant in possession <i>asked</i>
to be admitted defendant, the Court was enabled to add <span class="smcap">Conditions</span>;
and therefore obliged him to <i>allow</i> the fiction, and go to
Trial on the <i>real merits</i>."&mdash;(<i>Fair Claim</i> v.
<i>Sham Title</i>,[*] 3 Burr. 1294.) This action is now, in effect, the only direct common-law
remedy for the recovery of land in England and Ireland; in many
of the United States of America the action of Ejectment is retained&mdash;"with
its harmless, and&mdash;as matter of history&mdash;curious and
amusing English fictions."&mdash;(4 <i>Kent's Comment</i>. p. 70, note <i>e</i>:) but
in New York, the action of Ejectment is "stripped of all its fictitious
parts."&mdash;(<i>Id. ib.</i>)</p>

<p>On the 22d August, 1843, (since the publication of this work,) a
brief but most important statute (6 and 7 Vict. c. 85) was enacted,
"for improving the Law of Evidence"&mdash;the chief object of which
was, to remove all such difficulties as that which formed the subject
of Mr. Parkinson's inquiries. Witnesses are now no longer "incompetent"
to give evidence by reason of <i>crime</i> or of any <i>interest</i>
which they may have in, or in respect of, the subject-matter of the action.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span></p>

<p>For this glorious and inestimable safeguard of the liberty of the
subject, we are indebted to the ancient common law of England,
strengthened from time to time by the legislature, and now made
secure against the insidious encroachments of tyranny. The chief
statute passed with this view is known as <i>The Habeas Corpus Act</i>
(31 Car. II. c. 2), and "has been incorporated into the jurisprudence
of every state in the Union" in America.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Story</span>, <i>Commentaries

<p>"It is a very common mistake," says Mr. Hallam, and the Lord
Chief-Justice of the Queen's Bench had occasion, during Michaelmas
Term 1844, publicly to make a similar observation, "not only among
foreigners, but many from whom some knowledge of our constitutional
laws might be expected, that the statute of Charles II. enlarged
in a great degree our liberties, and forms a sort of epoch in
their history; but though a very beneficial enactment, it introduced
no new principle, nor conferred any right upon the subject....
It was not to bestow an immunity from arbitrary imprisonment,
which is abundantly provided in Magna Charta (if, indeed, not
much more ancient,) that the statute of Charles II. was enacted;
but to cut off the abuses by which the government's lust of power,
and the servile subtlety of crown lawyers, had impaired so fundamental
a privilege."&mdash;3 <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. <i>Const. Hist.</i>, pp. 16, 17.</p>

<p>The general character of the Newspaper Press, both in London
and the country, has so greatly improved of late years, as (with a

<p>Till within a few years before the period in question, the law of
England regarded the act done by Mr. Steggars as amounting only
to a <i>breach of trust</i>, and consequently subjecting him to no <i>criminal</i>
liability; on the ground that the £700 <i>never having been actually
in his master's possession</i>, could not be the subject of a <i>felonious
taking</i>. The alarming consequences of this doctrine led to the
passing of stat. 39 Geo. III. c. 85, [passed on the 12th July 1799,]
which declared such an act of embezzlement to be felony, punishable
with fourteen years' transportation: this was lately repealed,
but re-enacted by stat. 7 and 8, Geo. IV. c. 29, § 47, [passed on the
21st June, 1827,] on the occasion of consolidating that branch of
the criminal law.&mdash;See 4 <span class="smcap">Coleridge's</span> <i>Blackst. Comment.</i> p. 231

<p>The popular maxim that "possession is nine-tenths of the law,"
is founded on the salutary and reasonable doctrine of the law, that
the party <i>in possession</i> of property is presumed to be the owner until
the contrary shall have been proved. Consider how intolerable,
and, in fact, destructive of civil society would be an opposite rule&mdash;if
every one in the enjoyment of property were liable to be called
upon to explain to any one challenging his right, how that right
had been acquired! By the operation of the rule laid down in the
text, a defendant in ejectment may (except in the case of landlord
and tenant) always defeat the action, simply by showing the real
title to be in <i>some third party</i>&mdash;without showing that the defendant
holds possession with the consent, or under the authority of
the real owner.&mdash;(<i>Roe</i> v. <i>Harvey</i>, 4 Burr. 2484; <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Barber</i>, 2
T. R. 749.) The defendant's evidence is thus altogether confined
to falsifying his adversary's proofs, or rebutting the presumptions
which arise out of them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Adams</span> <i>on Ejectment</i>, p. 319.&mdash;(3d Ed.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span></p>

<p>Lynx is here glancing at a rule of the Roman law on a point of
great difficulty, interest, and importance&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> where two persons
above the age of puberty perished by the same accident, the younger
was presumed to have been the survivor; but if one was <i>under</i> the
age of puberty, the other was presumed to have been the survivor.&mdash;(Dig.
lib. 34, tit. 5, §§ 9, 22, 23.) It is very curious to see how
this question is dealt with in modern times. The <i>Code Civile</i> (in
France) adjusts the presumption to specific periods of life. If those
who perished were all under 15 years of age, the eldest is presumed to
have survived; if all above 60 years, the youngest. If some
under 15, and others above 60, the former shall be presumed to
have survived. If all were between 15 and 60 years of age, the
male, (when the ages are equal, or within a year of being so) shall
be presumed the survivor. If of the same sex, that presumption
shall be admitted which opens the succession in the order of nature&mdash;of
course the younger being presumed to have survived the elder.&mdash;(<i>Code
Civ</i>. §§ 720-722.) It has been objected, that, though
these rules are generally equitable, they are imperfect: for a man
above sixty ought surely to be held to have survived a mere infant;
and no provision is made for the case of persons under 15, and under
60 years of age perishing together. By the <i>Mohammedan law of
India</i>, "when relations perish together, it is to be presumed that
they all died at the same moment, and the heir of each immediately
succeeds." The difficulty of the case arises, of course, from the
circumstance of there being no evidence whatever as to the <i>actual
fact</i> of survivorship. Our English law has not adopted any definite
rule on the subject, but leans in favor of the survivorship of the
party possessed of the property in dispute; and <i>some</i> regard seems
to be had to the probability of the survivorship of the stronger
party. Several very interesting cases of this kind have arisen in
this country; and, generally speaking, our courts appear to have
required some evidence of the <i>fact</i>. A singular case occurred in
Queen Elizabeth's time, (1596.) Father and son were hanged at
the same time, in one cart; being joint tenants of property, which,
on their death, was to go to the <i>son's</i> heirs. According to one
report (Noy) the <i>father's</i> feet were seen moving after the son's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
death; but other witnesses swore to the son's "shaking his legs"
after his father's death. This the jury believed; found that the
son survived; and his widow was therefore held entitled to her
dower!&mdash;(<i>Broughton</i> v. <i>Randall</i>, Cro. El., p. 502.)</p>
